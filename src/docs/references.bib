  abstract = {Virtual manufacturing systems provide a useful means for products to be manufactured ‘right the first time’ without the need of physical testing on the shop floor. Earlier research was mostly on developing a virtual manufacturing environment. Over the years, simple graphical prediction and simulation gave way to complex multi-science predictions. Virtual systems such as Virtual Machine Tool, Virtual Machining, Virtual Assembly, Virtual Tooling and Virtual Prototype have been developed to support virtual manufacturing. Different systems and approaches have different targeted applications. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of existing virtual systems. Their focuses and approaches (i.e. virtual reality, Web-based techniques, mathematical modelling, hardware interactions and STEP-NC-based methodologies) are discussed in detail. To better understand the systems, we have categorized them into different groups according to their application domains. Discussions and concluding remarks are given based on the review.},

  abstract = {Digital manufacturing concept is gaining a lot of attention and popularity due to its enormous benefits. It is considered as one of the pillars or component of Industry 4.0. With the advancements in technology, digital manufacturing is becoming a reality rather than a concept only. It is applied to various stages of the manufacturing process such as design, prototyping, and assembly training. Virtual reality (VR) is a cog in a wheel of digital manufacturing. It can be used in various phases of manufacturing. Planning and conducting assembly operations account for the majority of the cost of a product. It is difficult to design and train assembly operations during the early stages of product design. Assembly is a vital step in manufacturing, so firms provide training to their employees and it costs them time and money. Therefore, this research work extends VR applications in manufacturing by integrating concepts and studies from training simulations to the evaluation of assembly training effectiveness and transfer of training. VR provides a platform for “learning by doing” instead of learning by seeing, listening, or observing. A series of user-based evaluation studies are conducted to ensure that the virtual manufacturing assembly simulation provides an effective and efficient means for evaluating assembly operations and for training assembly personnel. Different feedback cues of VR are implemented to evaluate the system. Moreover, several case studies are used to assess the effectiveness of VR-based training. The results of the study reveal that participants trained by VR committed fewer errors and took lesser time in actual product assembly when compared against the participant from traditional or baseline training group.},

The development of mental workload (MWL) measures therefore looms large. Physiological gauges such as electroencephalography (EEG) show promising possibilities, but still lack sufficient reliability when applied in the field. This study presents an alternative measure with a substantial ecological validity. First, we developed a behavioral video coding scheme identifying 11 assembly behaviors potentially revealing MWL being too high. Subsequently, we explored its validity by analyzing videos of 24 participants performing a high and a low complexity assembly. Results showed that five of the behaviors identified, such as freezing and the amount of part rotations, significantly differed in occurrence and/or duration between the two conditions. The study hereby proposes a novel and naturalistic method that could help practitioners to map and redesign critical assembly phases, and researchers to enrich validation of MWLmeasures through measurement triangulation.},

In this research paper, VR is applied in engineering education, the scope being to compare three major VR systems with the traditional education approach when we do not use any VR system (No-VR). The Corner Cave System (CCS) is compared with the Head Mounted Display (HMD) system. Both of these systems are using a tracking system to reflect the user movements in the virtual environment. The CCS uses only three coordinates: x-, y- and z-axis. The HMD system has six degrees of freedom, the x-, y- and z-axis, as well as the roll, pitch and yaw. Those two systems are also compared with HMD, as a standalone device (HMD-SA) without the tracking system where it has only roll, pitch and yaw. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of VR systems on the students’ achievements in engineering colleges. The research examined the effect of the four different methods and compared the scores of the students after each test. The experiments were ran over 48 students. Those systems show incredible results.},

It discusses the normative stance towards the entire educational process, whose implications range from the private appropriation of personally significant learning to social transformation and global educational renewal. The distinguishing feature of experience-based learning is that the experience of the learner occupies central place in all considerations of teaching and learning. The history of learning through experience follows the history of epistemology itself—the search for the basis of true knowledge. The terms experience and experiment are etymologically one. The Italian educator Maria Montessori’s work can be understood as what we today call EBL. Workplace implementation of EBL involves the conscious attempt to establish situations which provide learning in a real context or in one that is as close to some aspect of the real context as can be designed.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load has for long been studied in relation with learning processes. In our study, we investigated the impact of cognitive load in real-life situation taking the example of train travelers looking for relevant information in a train station. For this purpose, we created a virtual reality model of the tested train station from which we conducted a real-life study. Our aim was to compare travelers’ cognitive load impact in real-life environmental condition versus virtual reality simulation of the same environment. Regular and occasional travelers were recruited and were assumed as experts and novices, respectively. Investigation of cognitive load was based on physiological, subjective and behavioral aspects. These were measured using electrodermal activity, NASA-Task Load Index and recognition of relevant factual and contextual information seen by travelers in the train station, respectively. These three indicators used in both real-life and virtual reality, were expected to follow the same trend, irrespective of the environmental condition, but were expected to vary with respect to expertise level. A higher cognitive load was forecasted for novice travelers than for expert travelers. The findings revealed no difference on the three indicators between virtual and real-life conditions. However, novice travelers showed higher cognitive load responses than expert travelers, in both environmental conditions. Our results suggest virtual reality as a promising technique for cognitive load analysis during navigation, and an effective method for neurocognitive assessments in daily life situations.},

  abstract = {The goal of this research is to present the effects of virtual learning environments, specifically designed according to the problem-based learning approach (PBL) for 7th-grade students’ science lessons. The effects of these specific environments on students’ academic success, problem-solving skills and motivations were carefully analyzed and interpreted. In this context, mixed-method, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, was adopted. The pre-test-post-test control group designs were used in the quantitative dimension of the study and the focus group interview was conducted with the experimental group students to support the quantitative findings. The study group of the research involved 68 students in 7th grade in a secondary school. At the end of the research, on the basis of the quantitative data analysis it can be said that: According to the last-tests of the experimental and control groups, the virtual learning environment designed on the basis of the problem-based learning approach was more efficient on increasing the academic success and problem-solving skills of the experimental group students when compared to the control group students. However, findings of the motivation survey indicate that motivations of the experimental and control groups didn’t significantly differentiate. According to the quantitative results of the research, experimental group students delivered positive opinions especially about making lessons more fun and relating to real-life, which are the parts of the virtual learning environment designed according to the problem-based learning approach. It was observed that, in terms of the activities, students had positive opinions mostly about giving the chance to discuss opinions and make interpretations. In addition to this, it was seen that the students believed that their problem-solving skills had developed thanks to the activities. Regarding the topic of conducting group studies while using virtual learning methods, students stated that they had positive opinions as these studies gave them the opportunity to exchange ideas. However, they were disturbed by the fact that there were too many irrelevant interpretations during the process.},

This study focused on determining how users’ spatial decision making and performance were affected by differences in spatial perception created by the IVRIE and DT systems. Factors examined included the differences between and within the two virtual systems, based on differences in texture, system usage sequence, and the complexity of the experiential/spatial guidelines. Descriptive and inferential statistical testing using quantitative and qualitative data were used to find differences in spatial perception and decision making. The results showed significant space size variations produced by participants between and within the two different VR systems.},

The Consensual Assessment Technique is based on the idea that the best measure of the creativity of a work of art, a theory, a research proposal, or any other artifact is the combined assessment of experts in that field. Unlike other measures of creativity, such as divergent-thinking tests, the Consensual Assessment Technique is not based on any particular theory of creativity, which means that its validity (which has been well established empirically) is not dependent upon the validity of any particular theory of creativity.

  abstract = {The early conceptual design phase often focuses on functional requirements, with limited consideration of the manufacturing processes needed to turn design engineers' conceptual models into physical products. Increasingly, design and manufacturing engineers no longer work in physical proximity, which has slowed the feedback cycle and increased product lead-time. Design for manufacturability (DFM) techniques have been adopted to overcome this problem and are critical for faster convergence to a manufacturable design. DFM tools give feedback in textual and graphical modalities. However, since information modality may affect interpretability, empirical evidence is needed to understand how manufacturability feedback modalities affect design engineers' work. A user study evaluated how novice design engineers' design performance, workload, confidence, and feedback usability were affected by textual, two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) feedback modalities. Results showed that graphical feedback significantly improved performance and reduced mental workload compared to textual and no feedback. Differences between 3D and 2D feedback were mixed. Three-dimensional was generally better on average, but not significantly so. However, the usability of 3D was significantly higher than 2D. Conversely, providing feedback in textual modality was often no better than not providing feedback. The study will benefit manufacturing industries by demonstrating that early 3D manufacturability feedback improves novice design engineers' performance with less mental workload and streamlines the design process resulting in cost-saving and reduction of product lead-time.},

In particular, the actual support of VR in early design phases and the diffusion of practices involving VR in creative design stages are argued. In the present paper, we reviewed VR applications in design and categorized each of the collected 86 sources into multiple classes. These range from supported design functions to employed VR technologies and the use of systems complementing VR. The identified design functions include not only design activities traditionally supported by VR, such as 3D modelling, virtual prototyping, and product evaluation, but also co-design and design education beyond the early design phases. The possibility to support early design phases by means of VR is mirrored by the attention on products that involve an emotional dimension beyond functional aspects, which are particularly focused on in virtual assemblies and prototypes. Relevant matches between VR technologies and specific design functions have been individuated, although a clear separation between VR devices and supported design tasks cannot be claimed.},

In this paper, task performance is measured by the time to complete a given engineering activity. Over the last decade, a wide range of virtual reality applications have been developed based on non-immersive and immersive virtual reality systems for educational purposes. However, a major limitation of nonimmersive virtual reality systems is the lack of an immersive experience that not only provides content to students, but also enables them to interact and learn in a completely 360 degree immersive environment. The authors of this work have developed a replica of a physical engineering laboratory in an interactive virtual learning environment. This research measures the difference in task performance between i) students exposed to an immersive virtual reality system and ii) students exposed to a non-immersive virtual reality system, in the interactive virtual environment developed by the research team. This research seeks to explore whether statistically significant differences in performance exist between these groups. Knowledge gained from testing this hypothesis will inform educators about the value and impact of immersive virtual reality technologies in enhancing online education. A case study involving 54 students in a product functional analysis task is used to test the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {In the recent studies additive manufacturing technology prove their importance in every field because of its accessibility increases as the earlier patents expired which gives an opportunity to the manufacturers to develop different types of 3D printing devices as per need. There are different types of material available in the market and for every type of material we need an additive manufacturing method to print these materials layer by layer on top of each other by using 3D CAD models (Mazzanti et al., 2019). In this paper we discusses wide range of materials in details with respective 3D printing techniques. Further materials which are most commonly used such as polymers, metals and alloys, composites, concrete, ceramics to the materials which are under development stages such as biomaterials, food printing materials, smart materials, glass, resin and wood are discussed in detail with their respective 3D printing methods. The scope of 3D printing in the suggested areas are concluded.},

  abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing involves manufacturing techniques that add material to produce metallic components, typically layer by layer. The substantial growth in this technology is partly driven by its opportunity for commercial and performance benefits in the aerospace industry. The fundamental opportunities for metal additive manufacturing in aerospace applications include: significant cost and lead-time reductions, novel materials and unique design solutions, mass reduction of components through highly efficient and lightweight designs, and consolidation of multiple components for performance enhancement or risk management, e.g. through internal cooling features in thermally loaded components or by eliminating traditional joining processes. These opportunities are being commercially applied in a range of high-profile aerospace applications including liquid-fuel rocket engines, propellant tanks, satellite components, heat exchangers, turbomachinery, valves, and sustainment of legacy systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of metal additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry (from industrial/popular as well as technical literature). This provides a current state of the art, while also summarizing the primary application scenarios and the associated commercial and technical benefits of additive manufacturing in these applications. Based on these observations, challenges and potential opportunities are highlighted for metal additive manufacturing for each application scenario.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has unique capabilities when compared to traditional manufacturing, such as shape, hierarchical, functional, and material complexity, a fact that has fascinated those in research, industry, and the media for the last decade. Consequently, designers would like to know how they can incorporate AM's special capabilities into their designs but are often at a loss as how to do so. Design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) methods are currently in development, but the vast majority of existing methods are not tailored to the needs and knowledge of designers in the early stages of the design process. Therefore, we propose a set of process-independent design heuristics for AM aimed at transferring the high-level knowledge necessary for reasoning about functions, configurations, and parts to designers. Twenty-nine design heuristics for AM are derived from 275 AM artifacts. An experiment is designed to test their efficacy in the context of a redesign scenario with novice designers. The heuristics are found to positively influence the designs generated by the novice designers and are found to be more effective at communicating DfAM concepts in the early phases of redesign than a lecture on DfAM alone. Future research is planned to validate the impact with expert designers and in original design scenarios.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have become integral to modern prototyping and manufacturing. Therefore, guidelines for using AM are necessary to help users new to the technology. Many others have proposed useful guidelines, but these are rarely written in a way that is accessible to novice users. Most guidelines (1) assume the user has extensive prior knowledge of the process, (2) apply to only a few AM technologies or a very specific application, or (3) describe benefits of the technology that novices already know. In this paper, we present a one-page, visual design for additive manufacturing worksheet for novice and intermittent users which addresses common mistakes as identified by various expert machinists and additive manufacturing facilities who have worked extensively with novices. The worksheet helps designers assess the potential quality of a part made using most AM processes and indirectly suggests ways to redesign it. The immediate benefit of the worksheet is to filter out bad designs before they are printed, thus saving time on manufacturing and redesign. We implemented this as a go-no-go test for a high-volume AM facility where users are predominantly novices, and we observed an 81\% decrease in the rate of poorly designed parts. We also tested the worksheet in a classroom, but found no difference between the control and the experimental groups. This result highlights the importance of motivation since the cost of using AM in this context was dramatically lower than real-world costs. This second result highlights the limitations of the worksheet.},

However, to achieve its full potential AM requires a step-change in design thinking, which makes Design for AM (DfAM) education and training crucial. This paper reports results from the first attempt to investigate the uptake of DfAM in higher education. This research required the development and administration of an articulated online survey, in which educators worldwide who teach AM and DfAM have participated. The results show that DfAM is taught in a considerable number of courses. However, the survey revealed that DfAM is seldom recognised as a distinct course or topic and the relevance attributed and proportion of teaching dedicated to DfAM within wider AM is typically marginal. DfAM is being mostly taught in North America and Europe and is also typically taught in institutions that are research active in AM or specifically DfAM, suggesting the subject has not yet reached maturity or diffusion into mainstream design and engineering curricula. It was interesting to find that currently, the contents of courses do not differ significantly between engineering and design programmes.},

Theories from higher education, management, communication, and other fields can inform change efforts but remain largely inaccessible to STEM education leaders, who are just beginning to view change as a scholarly endeavor informed by the research literature. Purpose This article describes the goals, assumptions, and underlying logic of selected change strategies with potential relevance to STEM higher education settings for a target audience of change agents, leaders, and researchers. Scope/Method This review is organized according to the Four Categories of Change Strategies model developed by Henderson, Beach, and Finkelstein (2011). We describe eight strategies of potential practical relevance to STEM education change efforts (two from each category). For each change strategy, we present a summary with key references, discuss their applicability to STEM higher education, provide a STEM education example, and discuss implications for change efforts and research. Conclusions Change agents are guided, often implicitly, by a single change strategy. These eight strategies will expand the repertoire of change agents by helping them consider change from a greater diversity of perspectives. Change agents can use these descriptions to design more robust change efforts. Improvements in the knowledge and theory base underlying change strategies will occur when change agents situate their writing about change initiatives using shared models, such as the one presented in this article, to make their underlying assumptions about change more explicit.},

We argue that now is an appropriate time in the development of the field of engineering education to both support systematic reviews and benefit from them. More reviews of prior work conducted more systematically would help advance the field by lowering the barrier for both researchers and practitioners to access the literature, enabling more objective critique of past efforts, identifying gaps, and proposing new directions for research. Purpose The purpose of this article is to introduce the methodology of systematic reviews to the field of engineering education and to adapt existing resources on systematic reviews to engineering education and other developing interdisciplinary fields. Scope/Method This article is primarily a narrative review of the literature on conducting systematic reviews. Methods are adapted to engineering education and similar developing interdisciplinary fields. To offer concrete, pertinent examples, we also conducted a systematic review of systematic review articles published on engineering education topics since 1990. Fourteen exemplars are presented in this article and used to illustrate systematic review procedures. Conclusions Systematic reviews can benefit the field of engineering education by synthesizing prior work, by better informing practice, and by identifying important new directions for research. Engineering education researchers should consider including systematic reviews in their repertoire of methodologies.},

Virtual learning environments can be used to build skills. Recent research in cognitive psychology and education has shown that acquisitions are linked to the initial context. This provides a challenge for virtual reality in education or training. A brief overview of transfer issues highlights five main ideas: (1) the type of transfer enables the virtual environment (VE) to be classified according to what is learned; (2) the transfer process can create conditions within the VE to facilitate transfer of learning; (3) specific features of VR must match and comply with transfer of learning; (4) transfer can be used to assess a VE’s effectiveness; and (5) future research on transfer of learning must examine the singular context of learning. This paper discusses how new perspectives in cognitive psychology influence and promote transfer of learning through the use of VEs.},

  abstract = {In industry, Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) is currently synonymous with expert knowledge and external consultants for many companies. Particularly in higher cost technologies, such as metal powder bed fusion, component design requires extensive additive manufacturing (AM) knowledge. If a part is improperly designed, then it can cause thousands of dollars of lost time and material through a failed print. To avoid this situation, specialists must be consulted throughout the printing process; however, the shortage of trained personnel familiar with AM can create a bottleneck during design. In order to help businesses identify candidate parts for Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM, this paper presents a DfAM worksheet to help engineers, drafters, and designers select good part candidates with little prior knowledge of the specific technology. This worksheet uses data from the literature to support the values used for design guidance. Example components are shown to demonstrate the worksheet process. Ratings of these components are then compared with expert raters’ assessments of their suitability for fabrication with PBF from a geometric standpoint. In addition to introducing the worksheet, preliminary user feedback about the worksheet is presented, and future work is discussed.},

Specifically, the tool analyzes the part geometry for potential problems regarding warping, toppling, poor surface finish, and small or overhanging features when the part is produced using fused-filament fabrication. This tool helps designers evaluate the manufacturability of their parts and provides suggestions to change part geometry and orientation to avoid print failures and improve part quality. In this study, Will It Print was used to redesign several models and to choose a build orientation for 3D printing. The original and redesigned models were printed and compared. The redesigned models had lower scrap rates and improved quality. Our open-source MATLAB tool enables novices to engage in virtual prototyping for 3D printing so they can print high-quality parts without inefficient trial-and-error printing. This tool will be especially helpful for students and practitioners with limited access to a 3D printer, such as in remote learning modalities, which have become prevalent in recent years.},

While the enactment of IDEA [20] has helped to promote access to education for people with ID and other disabilities, there are still obstacles to employment. Misconceptions about ability and lack of opportunities to learn and practice employability skills contribute to this problem. Our research explores employability and integration through the lens of 3D printing, an innovative technology touted as a means to self-employment. We successfully taught young adults with intellectual disabilities many technical skills required for 3D printing through an integrated, post-secondary course on 3D printing for entrepreneurship. In this paper we report on our methods for designing this course and discuss the benefits, challenges, and strategies for teaching 3D printing to an integrated cohort of students.

  abstract = {Hardly a day goes by that we don't see an announcement for some new product or technology that is going to make our lives easier, solve some or all of our problems, or simply make the world a better place. However, the reality is that few of these products survive, much less deliver on their promise. But are we learning from these expensive mistakes? Rather than rethink the underlying process that brings these products to market, the more common strategy seems to be the shotgun method, that is, keep blasting away in the hope that one of the pellets will eventually hit the bull's eye. This book's goal is to help with this problem: to inspire and encourage HCI and other design professionals to try new methods, test themselves with the exercises and projects, and see an improvement in innovative interaction design that works. Some of these methods are sketching-based, taking methods that have been traditionally used for design. Others are prototyping methods that have been traditionally used for testing and evaluating design in HCI. The result is a group of methods and process that successfully work in both HCI and design. This helps to give these fields a unity as well as a uniquely innovative way to design user experience. -- Publisher description},

  abstract = {Scientific evaluation of prototyping practices is an emerging field in design research. Prototyping is critical to the success of product development efforts, and yet its implementation in practice is often guided by ad hoc experience. To address this need, we seek to advance the study and development of prototyping principles, techniques, and tools. A method to repeatedly enhance the outcome of prototyping efforts is reported in this paper. The research methodology to develop this method is as follows: (1) systematically identify practices that improve prototyping; (2) synthesize these practices to form a guiding method for designers; and (3) validate that the proposed method encourages best practices and improves performance. Prototyping practices are represented as six key heuristics to guide a designer in planning: how many iterations to pursue, how many unique design concepts to explore in parallel, as well as the use of scaled prototypes, isolated subsystem prototypes, relaxed requirements, and virtual prototypes. The method is correlated, through experimental investigation, with increased application of these best practices and improved design performance outcomes. These observations hold across various design problems studied. This method is novel in providing a systematic approach to prototyping.},

It involves standardizing the units of text on which coders work and then improving the coding scheme?s discriminant capability (i.e., reducing coding errors) to an acceptable point as indicated by measures of either intercoder reliability or intercoder agreement. This approach is especially useful for situations where a single knowledgeable coder will code all the transcripts once the coding scheme has been established. This approach can also be used with other types of qualitative data and in other circumstances.},

Using sequential analysis, this study investigated how the hands-on activity influenced the students' behavioral patterns in learning. The results showed that all of the students' learning performances and hands-on abilities were enhanced. Moreover, the students who used VR technology achieved both significantly better learning performances and hands-on abilities, indicating that VR might be able to help the students understand abstract scientific concepts and build mental models, which they used to internalize and organize knowledge structures. Furthermore, this study discovered that the students who learned using VR technology formed a cyclical learning pattern, starting with a group discussion (G), moving on to solving problems (S) and developing a product (D), and then going back to another group discussion. However, the students who learned via lectures produced a linear learning pattern in the order of G→S→D.},

This meta-analysis includes 145 empirical studies and investigates the effectiveness of different scaffolding types and technology in simulation-based learning environments to facilitate complex skills. The simulations had a large positive overall effect: g = 0.85, SE = 0.08; CIs [0.69, 1.02]. Technology use and scaffolding had positive effects on learning. Learners with high prior knowledge benefited more from reflection phases; learners with low prior knowledge learned better when supported by examples. Findings were robust across different higher education domains (e.g., medical and teacher education, management). We conclude that (1) simulations are among the most effective means to facilitate learning of complex skills across domains and (2) different scaffolding types can facilitate simulation-based learning during different phases of the development of knowledge and skills.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Innovation in design depends on successful concept generation. The ideation stage of design is intended to produce multiple, varied concepts from which to develop and choose. Often, instruction on idea generation methods is not offered in engineering classes; however, when taught, it is commonly through techniques like brainstorming, which lacks specific ways to generate designs. Further, existing ideation strategies are not based on evidence from designers or rigorous testing through empirical studies. PURPOSE This study investigated how engineering students and practitioners generated ideas. We focused on how designers used product characteristics to define concepts, and how previous concepts were transformed into new solutions by modifying their characteristics. Our methodology is based on our previous work identifying Design Heuristics in engineering solutions, defined as cognitive prompts that facilitate exploration of multiple designs during concept generation. METHOD Think-aloud recordings and concept sketches were collected from 36 engineering students and practitioners (with varying levels of experience) as they generated ideas for a novel design task in a laboratory setting. These data, along with retrospective interviews, were analyzed for the ideation strategies evident in the participants’ solutions. RESULTS This study revealed evidence for over 60 strategies for concept generation during the ideation stage. Participants generated novel concepts and proposed concept modifications, and specific Design Heuristics were observed in their designs. The results suggest instruction on Design Heuristics can aid in effective idea generation. CONCLUSIONS This protocol study of engineering designers provides a collection of heuristics observed in practice that offers new methods for students and practitioners to explore design spaces. The Design Heuristics identified in this and previous work can potentially be learned and then incorporated into the practice of engineering students and practitioners.},

These concepts are not easy to grasp and can be tedious when taught by traditional methods. This study presents an innovative virtual reality (VR) based approach to teach manufacturing systems concepts. To illustrate the efficacy and effectiveness of VR technology in enhancing students learning concepts, a VR queuing theory teaching module is developed. The efficacy and effectiveness of the VR module are then analyzed for male and female participants to investigate the impact of the VR environment on female engineers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Simulation sickness, system usability, and user experience tools were used to assess the efficacy of the VR module, and the queuing theory quiz, NASA TLX assessment, and post-motivation measures were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed VR module. Both males and females indicated higher user satisfaction in terms of system usability. Female participants perceived higher user experience than their male counterparts. Both male and female participants experienced similar simulation sickness symptoms throughout the study. The quiz score indicated that students performed well in the conceptual section for both genders. The NASA TLX results suggested that participants required low perceived work effort in regard to performing the tasks in the module. The post motivation results confirmed that the VR module created positive motivation in learning the queueing theory for both male and female students. Overall, the efficacy and effectiveness measures affirm that both male and female participants perceived a similar experience in the developed VR teaching module.},

  abstract = {Powder bed fusion (PBF) is recognized as one of the most common additive manufacturing technologies because of its attractive capability of fabricating complex geometries using many possible materials. However, the quality and reliability of parts produced by this technology are observed to be crucial aspects. In addition, the challenges of PBF-produced parts are hot issues among stakeholders because parts are still insufficient to meet the strict requirements of high-tech industries. This paper discusses the present state of the art in PBF and technological challenges, with a focus on selective laser melting (SLM). The review work focuses mainly on articles that emphasize the status and challenges of PBF metal-based AM, and the study is primarily limited to open-access sources, with special attention given to the process parameters and flaws as a determining factor for printed part quality and reliability. Moreover, the common defects due to an unstrained process parameter of SLM and those needed to monitor and sustain the quality and reliability of components are encompassed. From this review work, it has been observed that there are several factors, such as laser parameters, powder characteristics, material properties of powder and the printing chamber environments, that affect the SLM printing process and the mechanical properties of printed parts. It is also concluded that the SLM process is not only expensive and slow compared with conventional manufacturing processes, but it also suffers from key drawbacks, such as its reliability and quality in terms of dimensional accuracy, mechanical strength and surface roughness.},

Here, we review a selection of the literature to contrast the value of physical and virtual investigations and to offer recommendations for combining the two to strengthen science learning.},

In industrial engineering education, computer simulations and digital games are commonly used to teach technical skills in supply chain management and production planning. Used alongside other teaching methods, they allow students to apply theories learnt and reflect on the impact of their decisions. Other "hands-on" games can also foster the development of professional skills such as leadership, teamwork and communication. Focusing on serious games and game-based learning in industrial engineering, this paper reviews examples to discuss games' benefits and drawbacks as educational tools. Finally, the author suggests ways for game developer to consider how game aspects align with learning outcomes in the cognitive and affective domains.},

While many tools focus on increasing the pace of development, few attempt to aide the designer in generating more creative solutions. In this work, we take creativity as the combination of novelty and utility. Particularly during development of user interfaces, assessment of utility (primarily usability) is iterative, rigorous, and time-consuming. The objective of the proposed work is to explore and evaluate the use of machine learning to predict usability measures for mobile app interfaces as a means to automate usability evaluations. Specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to accurately (nearly 90\%) predict three usability measures: regularity, complexity, and touchability. This tool automates the assessment of utility in app design, freeing up the designer to seek designs that are novel and thus creative.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a group of processes which manufacture a part by adding sequential layers of material on each other. In the last decade, these processes have been extensively applied in industry for constructing small volumes of complex, customized parts. Since parts are built layer-by-layer, the build orientation affects the surface quality and the total cost of the part. The search for optimal build orientation is not trivial since these factors are, typically, in conflict with each other. The major limitation of the methods described in the literature to choose the optimal build direction is in the insufficient accuracy of the estimates of the manufacturing cost and of the surface quality. These factors are very complex to be estimated, and accuracy in their evaluation requires methods that are very time-consuming. On the contrary, in practical use, a multi-objective optimization process requires an objective function that is reliable and easy to be evaluated. In order to overcome these problems, in this paper, original methods to estimate the manufacturing cost and surface quality as a function of build orientation are presented. They are implemented, for the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology, in a multi-objective optimization problem that is solved by an S-metric selection evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (SMS-EMOA), obtaining an approximation of the Pareto front. The final selection of the recommended orientation is performed by the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Properly designed case studies are used to evaluate the reliability of the proposed method, and the results are compared with the state-of-the-art method to find optimal build orientation.},

Because of this, engineers and designers need to be taught a new set of skills in design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) in order to become competent in designing parts that maximize the benefits offered by AM. Around the world, universities and organizations are beginning to offer courses in DfAM to improve the skills of modern engineers and designers. Staff at Lund University, in Sweden, have begun to offer such DfAM courses to industry that use problem-based learning (PBL) as the pedagogical approach to teaching DfAM in a more effective way.

Recent AM advances include shaping nickel-based superalloys for lightweight aerospace applications, reducing environmental impacts with large-scale concrete printing, and personalizing food and medical devices for improved health. Although many new capabilities are enabled by AM, design advances are necessary to ensure the technology reaches its full potential. Here, DfAM research is reviewed in the context of Fabrication, Generation, and Assessment phases that bridge the gap between AM capabilities and design innovations. Materials, processes, and constraints are considered during fabrication steps to understand AM capabilities for building systems with specified properties and functions. Design generation steps include conceptualization, configuration, and optimization to drive the creation of high-performance AM designs. Assessment steps are necessary for validating, testing, and modeling systems for future iterations and improvements. These phases provide context for discussing innovations in aerospace, automotives, construction, food, medicine, and robotics while highlighting future opportunities for design services, bio-inspired design, fabrication robots, and machine learning. Overall, DfAM has positively impacted diverse engineering applications, and further research has great potential for driving new developments in design innovation.},

Three dimensional modeling is an application in which integration with VR technology is still in the development stage. The focus of this research is to evaluate the feasibility for computer-aided design in VR and to identify the best set of features for virtual reality modeling and practices in this new domain. A platform for testing CAD in VR is developed through the integration of CAD software with a game engine and compared against traditional CAD methods through testing. Modeling capabilities included previews, creating solid rectangular prisms and spheres, lock to grid, and cuts of similar shapes. User testing with four different models (i.e. chair, maze, truck, sculpture) and survey responses suggest respectively that design in virtual reality promoted greater creativity in modeling, allowed for a greater feature creation rate, and that a slight majority of test participants preferred modeling in VR compared to traditional CAD applications.},

  abstract = {Background Economic globalization, rapid advances in technology and cognitive science, and a worldwide movement toward outcomes-based program accreditation increasingly require changes in the traditional model of engineering education design and delivery. As yet, no validated framework exists for designing instructional development programs that would equip engineering educators to make those changes. Existing programs consequently vary considerably in scope and effectiveness across countries and institutions. Purpose This article reviews the content and structures of instructional development programs around the world and formulates a robust framework for designing and delivering effective programs for engineering educators. Scope/Method Literature on the design, implementation, and evaluation of instructional development programs is reviewed and summarized. Five criteria drawn from Raymond Wlodkowski's theory of adult learner motivation (expertise of instructors, relevance of content, choice in application, praxis [action plus reflection], and groupwork) are proposed as a framework for designing engineering instructional development programs, and the framework is applied to formulate recommendations for making programs effective. Research questions that should be explored to validate the framework are suggested. Conclusion Wlodkowski's five-factor theory of adult learner motivation provides a good framework for the design of engineering instructional development programs. The criteria are compatible with the cognitive science-based How People Learn instructional model and also with recommendations of faculty development authorities. Making engineering instructional development effective at an institution will require applying the criteria to program design and delivery and creating an institutional expectation of faculty participation in the programs.},

To that end a pair of studies were carried out. The first study was conducted with industry engineers and designers, while the second study was conducted with students at a university. For both studies, four DfAM design rules for fused deposition modelling (FDM) were chosen, relating to overhangs, planar surfaces, accessible support structures, and part size. Each rule was presented in four different modalities: text only, text with illustration, text with industry example, and text with 3D printed example. Each rule presentation included a justification, and all but the text-only presentation included a ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’ design example for the rule. Four part redesign problems were given, and the resulting redesigns were then rated on both novelty and quality. Results indicate that although there are no differences in quality and novelty scores between modalities, the text only rules were perceived to be the most difficult to understand. Furthermore, a comparison between the professionals and the students showed that the professionals created higher novelty redesigns. These results have several implications in the field of DfAM education.},

This mixed-methods study analyzes pretest and posttests covering topics that require spatial visualization skills as well as surveys and interviews of the students using the virtual reality tools. Quantitative results indicate that students are able to identify and visualize buckling modes more accurately after the virtual reality experience. Qualitatively, students express an improved understanding, increased enthusiasm for the topic, and greater desire for other topics to be presented using virtual reality tools. Both instructors and students note the advantages of using virtual reality to explain and understand the complex deformation modes of buckling structural members. Students feel they have a stronger understanding of concepts after the experience and, on average, show a statistically significant improvement on the posttest evaluating their understanding.},

In this paper, consideration is given to the role of one such advanced manufacturing process technology: additive manufacturing. The consequences of adopting this novel production technology on industrial sustainability are not well understood and this exploratory study draws on publically available data to provide insights into the impacts of additive manufacturing on sustainability. Benefits are found to exist across the product and material life cycles through product and process redesign, improvements to material input processing, make-to-order component and product manufacturing, and closing the loop. As an immature technology, there are substantial challenges to these benefits being realised at each stage of the life cycle.

  abstract = {The emergence of additive manufacturing and 3D printing technologies is introducing industrial skills deficits and opportunities for new teaching practices in a range of subjects and educational settings. In response, research investigating these practices is emerging across a wide range of education disciplines, but often without reference to studies in other disciplines. Responding to this problem, this article synthesizes these dispersed bodies of research to provide a state‐of‐the‐art literature review of where and how 3D printing is being used in the education system. Through investigating the application of 3D printing in schools, universities, libraries and special education settings, six use categories are identified and described: (1) to teach students about 3D printing; (2) to teach educators about 3D printing; (3) as a support technology during teaching; (4) to produce artefacts that aid learning; (5) to create assistive technologies; and (6) to support outreach activities. Although evidence can be found of 3D printing‐based teaching practices in each of these six categories, implementation remains immature, and recommendations are made for future research and education policy.},

The enhanced model shares the common goal with Dalgarno and Lee of identifying the learning benefits from using 3-D VLEs. The approach adopted here is to attempt a more pedagogical description using the concept of pedagogical immersion as derived from Mayes and Fowler's framework for mapping stages of learning onto types of learning environment. The paper adopts a “design for learning” perspective and in doing so hopes the combined framework will prove useful to those designing learning activities in 3-D VLEs.},

  abstract = {Background\enspace{} Virtual reality simulators combined with head-mounted displays enable highly immersive virtual reality (VR) for surgical skills training, potentially bridging the gap between the simulation environment and real-life operating room conditions. However, the increased complexity of the learning situation in immersive VR could potentially induce high cognitive load thereby inhibiting performance and learning. This study aims to compare cognitive load and performance in immersive VR and conventional VR simulation training. Methods\enspace{} A randomized controlled trial of residents (n\,=\,31) performing laparoscopic salpingectomies with an ectopic pregnancy in either immersive VR or conventional VR simulation. Cognitive load was estimated by secondary-task reaction time at baseline, and during nonstressor and stressor phases of the procedure. Simulator metrics were used to evaluate performance. Results\enspace{} Cognitive load was increased by 66\% and 58\% during immersive VR and conventional VR simulation, respectively (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), compared to baseline. A light stressor induced a further increase in cognitive load by 15.2\% and a severe stressor by 43.1\% in the immersive VR group compared to 23\% (severe stressor) in the conventional VR group. Immersive VR also caused a significantly worse performance on most simulator metrics. Conclusion\enspace{} Immersive VR simulation training induces a higher cognitive load and results in a poorer performance than conventional VR simulation training in laparoscopy. High extraneous load and element interactivity in the immersive VR are suggested as mechanisms explaining this finding. However, immersive VR offers some potential advantages over conventional VR such as more real-life conditions but we only recommend introducing immersive VR in surgical skills training after initial training in conventional VR.},

  abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, five major shifts in engineering education are identified. During the engineering science revolution, curricula moved from hands-on practice to mathematical modeling and scientific analyses. The first shift was initiated by engineering faculty members from Europe; accelerated during World War II, when physicists contributed multiple engineering breakthroughs; codified in the Grinter report; and kick-started by Sputnik. Did accreditation hinder curricular innovations? Were engineering graduates ready for practice? Spurred by these questions, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) required engineering programs to formulate outcomes, systematically assess achievement, and continuously improve student learning. The last three shifts are in progress. Since the engineering science revolution may have marginalized design, a distinctive feature of engineering, faculty members refocused attention on capstone and first-year engineering design courses. However, this third shift has not affected the two years in between. Fourth, research on learning and education continues to influence engineering education. Examples include learning outcomes and teaching approaches, such as cooperative learning and inquiry that increase student engagement. In shift five, technologies (e.g., the Internet, intelligent tutors, personal computers, and simulations) have been predicted to transform education for over 50 years; however, broad transformation has not yet been observed. Together, these five shifts characterize changes in engineering education over the past 100 years.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is poised to bring about a revolution in the way products are designed, manufactured, and distributed to end users. This technology has gained significant academic as well as industry interest due to its ability to create complex geometries with customizable material properties. AM has also inspired the development of the maker movement by democratizing design and manufacturing. Due to the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of technologies associated with AM, there is a lack of a comprehensive set of design principles, manufacturing guidelines, and standardization of best practices. These challenges are compounded by the fact that advancements in multiple technologies (for example materials processing, topology optimization) generate a ‘‘positive feedback loop’’ effect in advancing AM. In order to advance research interest and investment in AM technologies, some fundamental questions and trends about the dependencies existing in these avenues need highlighting. The goal of our review paper is to organize this body of knowledge surrounding AM, and present current barriers, findings, and future trends significantly to the researchers. We also discuss fundamental attributes of AM processes, evolution of the AM industry, and the affordances enabled by the emergence of AM in a variety of areas such as geometry processing, material design, and education. We conclude our paper by pointing out future directions such as the ‘‘print-it-all’’ paradigm, that have the potential to re-imagine current research and spawn completely new avenues for exploration.},

  abstract = {Operator training in the chemical industry is important because of the potentially hazardous nature of procedures and the way operators' mistakes can have serious consequences on process operation and safety. Currently, operator training is facing some challenges, such as high costs, safety limitations and time constraints. Also, there have been some indications of a lack of engagement of employees during mandatory training. Immersive technologies can provide solutions to these challenges. Specifically, virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the way chemical operators experience training sessions, increasing motivation, virtually exposing operators to unsafe situations, and reducing classroom training time. In this paper, we present research being conducted to develop a virtual reality training solution as part of the EU Horizon 2020 CHARMING Project, a project focusing on the education of current and future chemical industry stakeholders. This paper includes the design principles for a virtual reality training environment including the features that enhance the effectiveness of virtual reality training such as game-based learning elements, learning analytics, and assessment methods.

  abstract = {The new product development process makes use of both virtual and physical prototypes. There is an increasing need to reduce the time and cost required when converting from one to the other. There is also a potential need to use them both simultaneously. Virtual Prototyping (VP) and Physical Prototyping (PP) are two techniques that have many similar goals, but which achieve them in very different ways. With VP, the approach is to create as precise a numerical model as possible in the easiest possible way, whereas PP creates a physical model. This paper tries to define VP in a sense where it can be compared and contrasted with PP. The most obvious common area is in the early stages of product development, namely conceptualisation. Two different experimental implementations of real-time integration of virtual and physical prototyping are described. A virtual CAD technique is also described that aims to create concept models in an intuitive form that may be suitable for artistic sculptors. A conclusion is made that PP (through the layer-based Rapid Prototyping (RP) technology) and VP are valuable techniques that can join together to form a powerful tool for rapid development of complex products.},

  abstract = {The importance of additive manufacturing (AM) to the future of product design and manufacturing systems demands educational programs tailored to embrace its fundamental principles and its innovative potential. Moreover, the breadth and depth of AM spans several traditional disciplines, presenting a challenge to instructors yet giving the opportunity to integrate knowledge via creative and challenging projects. This paper presents our approach to teaching AM at the graduate and advanced undergraduate level, in the form of a 15-week course developed and taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The lectures begin with indepth technical analysis of the major AM processes, then focus on special topics including design methods, machine controls, and applications of AM toward current industry needs and emerging materials and length scales. In lab sessions, students operate and characterize desktop AM machines, and work in teams to design and fabricate a bridge having maximum strength per unit weight while conforming to geometric constraints. The class culminates in a semester-long team design-build project; in a single semester of the course, teams created prototype machines for printing molten glass, soft-serve ice cream, biodegradable (chitosan) material, carbon fiber composites, performing large-area parallel extrusion, and for in situ optical scanning during printing. Several of these projects led to patents, future research, and peer-reviewed publications. We conclude that AM education, while arguably rooted in mechanical engineering, must be truly multidisciplinary, and education programs must embrace this context. We also comment on our experiences adapting this course to a manufacturing-focused master’s degree program and a oneweek professional short program.},

A series of education-related research projects was therefore launched by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany (BMBF), of which the cooperative project ELLI - “Excellent Teaching and Learning in Engineering Science” is one among the most extensive. Of the three universities involved, namely RWTH Aachen University, Ruhr-Universität Bochum and TU Dortmund University, the last is at the center of the development of remote and virtual labs for mechanical engineering education with a focus on manufacturing technology. A tele-operative material characterization testing cell was conceptualized and implemented, along with a remote lab for incremental tube forming. To make further use of the remote labs, a Massive-Open-Online-Course (MOOC) was created which incorporates remote labs as part of the applied didactic methods. To overcome the limits of remote labs, virtual representations of these labs and a general virtual experimentation lab were developed. They are designed for different devices enabling the students to explore and experiment complex processes visually. All these measures are currently being integrated into various lectures in different study programs. In the second funding phase, ELLI2, the spectrum of the developed labs is broadened by the inclusion of new processes and introduction of technologies, such as Augmented Reality and Additive Manufacturing.},

  abstract = {With the rise in popularity of additive manufacturing (AM), relevant design methodologies have become necessary for designers to reap the full benefits from this technology. TRIZ is a problem-solving tool developed to assist with innovative and creative solutions. This paper aims to create a new TRIZ matrix specifically developed for designers using additive manufacturing. The TRIZ matrix offers designers general innovative design solutions to improve specific features of a design while not sacrificing the effectiveness of other features. The proposed matrix can help effective design decision making for additive manufacturing in an early design process as well as a redesign process. Also, a design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) worksheet is provided to enable users to easily find specific design solutions for certain additive manufacturing techniques based on the general solutions derived by the TRIZ matrix. To illustrate the potential of this AM specific TRIZ matrix, case studies are presented.},

  abstract = {Maintainability is an important characteristic of complex products. Good maintainability design can save substantial costs and reduce incidents and accidents throughout the product life cycle. Therefore, maintainability should be given full consideration in the early design stages. However, the current desktop tools are not effective to aid in maintainability design. Virtual reality (VR), a state-of-the-art of computer science, generates a virtual environment in which the user can have intuitive feelings and interact with virtual objects. In this paper, an immersive maintainability verification and evaluation system (IMVES) based on virtual reality is proposed. The goal of the system is to develop a cost-effective, rapid and precise method to improve the maintainability design in the early design stages. IMVES enables the user to interact with maintenance objects and conduct immersive simulations. Based on the developed methods, the data generated during simulation can be gathered to analyze the maintainability status. A case study applying IMVES into an aero-engine project is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the system. Compared with desktop-based methods, the IMVES could provide a more efficient way to conduct a maintenance simulation. Furthermore, the credibility and objectivity of the maintainability evaluation are also improved.},

The current study demonstrates that VR and 3D prototyping in the context of project-based learning (PBL) promote effective communication, increase problem solving skills, and enhance learning outcomes. VR and digital prototyping have been extensively used in industries for the purpose of product design and usability evaluation. In the context of engineering education, many research studies have attempted to explore the effect of VR on teamwork, engagement, retention, and motivation. In this paper, VR is used in conjunction with PBL in self-directed approach to design and implement a product using 3D software whilst also using virtual reality immersive CAVE display to evaluate their design. The hypothesis is that the use of VR with a project-based-learning approach to facilitate the attainment of desirable goals in the engineering design project, improved achievement of course learning outcomes and promoted effective communication. According to the research findings, VR approach significantly affected the distribution of cumulative project grades. Students’ project grades improved, particularly the implementation component. In addition, the course outcomes related to project design were better achieved in VR approach. The communication and problem-solving skills were improved in the VR approach as compared to traditional approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The adoption of immersive virtual reality (I-VR) as a pedagogical method in education has challenged the conceptual definition of what constitutes a learning environment. High fidelity graphics and immersive content using head-mounted-displays (HMD) have allowed students to explore complex subjects in a way that traditional teaching methods cannot. Despite this, research focusing on learning outcomes, intervention characteristics, and assessment measures associated with I-VR use has been sparse. To explore this, the current systematic review examined experimental studies published since 2013, where quantitative learning outcomes using HMD based I-VR were compared with less immersive pedagogical methods such as desktop computers and slideshows. A literature search yielded 29 publications that were deemed suitable for inclusion. Included papers were quality assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). Most studies found a significant advantage of utilising I-VR in education, whilst a smaller number found no significant differences in attainment level regardless of whether I-VR or non-immersive methods were utilised. Only two studies found clear detrimental effects of using I-VR. However, most studies used short interventions, did not examine information retention, and were focused mainly on the teaching of scientific topics such as biology or physics. In addition, the MERSQI showed that the methods used to evaluate learning outcomes are often inadequate and this may affect the interpretation of I-VR’s utility. The review highlights that a rigorous methodological approach through the identification of appropriate assessment measures, intervention characteristics, and learning outcomes is essential to understanding the potential of I-VR as a pedagogical method.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}New computer technologies, like virtual reality (VR), have created opportunities to study human behavior and train skills in novel ways. VR holds significant promise for maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of skill learning in a variety of settings (e.g., sport, medicine, safety-critical industries) through immersive learning and augmentation of existing training methods. In many cases the adoption of VR for training has, however, preceded rigorous testing and validation of the simulation tool. In order for VR to be implemented successfully for both training and psychological experimentation it is necessary to first establish whether the simulation captures fundamental features of the real task and environment, and elicits realistic behaviors. Unfortunately evaluation of VR environments too often confuses presentation and function, and relies on superficial visual features that are not the key determinants of successful training outcomes. Therefore evidence-based methods of establishing the fidelity and validity of VR environments are required. To this end, we outline a taxonomy of the subtypes of fidelity and validity, and propose a variety of practical methods for testing and validating VR training simulations. Ultimately, a successful VR environment is one that enables transfer of learning to the real-world. We propose that key elements of psychological, affective and ergonomic fidelity, are the real determinants of successful transfer. By adopting an evidence-based approach to VR simulation design and testing it is possible to develop valid environments that allow the potential of VR training to be maximized.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The learning outcomes related to it have been mostly positive but the measurement methods are not without problems. This review provides an overview of active learning, especially in the context of engineering higher education, by answering two research questions: (1) How is the concept of active learning defined and justified in engineering higher education research? (2) What are the learning outcomes connected to active learning and how is learning measured in engineering higher education research? Sixty-six empirical articles were analyzed inductively with qualitative content analysis. The analysis showed that active learning was defined in various ways, and in some articles, it was not defined at all. In addition, justification (theoretical or empirical) for the use of active learning was seldomly reported. Finally, the indicators used to measure the impact of active learning on students’ learning outcomes were mostly based on students’ self-report data and focused on course specific development in subject-related knowledge. More thorough descriptions and theoretical justifications, as well as the consideration of learning outcomes with appropriate research methods, could reinforce the transparency of empirical interventions and the application of active learning.},

  abstract = {Background Over the past decade, there has been a shift in science, technology, engineering and math education, especially in engineering, towards a competency-based pedagogy. Competency-based learning (CBL) is an outcome-based, student-centered form of instruction where students progress to more advanced work upon mastering the necessary prerequisite content and skills. Many articles have been published on the implementation of CBL in engineering higher education; however, the literature lacks a systematic review that summarizes prior work to inform both future research and practice. Purpose The purpose of this review is to integrate previous literature as well as identify gaps in competency-based engineering higher education research. It summarizes the different approaches for implementing CBL, the effects of the pedagogy on student outcomes, tools to enhance its effectiveness, and assessment strategies. In addition, suggestions and recommendations for future research are provided. Method Engineering education articles were obtained from several EBSCO educational databases. The search was limited to articles published from 2005-2015, and inclusion criteria consisted of peer-reviewed journal articles that address the use of CBL in engineering higher education. Articles were then classified into several categories, summarized, and evaluated. Conclusions Theoretical and applied perspectives are provided that address both the theoretical basis for the effectiveness of CBL and practical aspects of implementing successful CBL instruction in engineering education. There are gaps in the literature regarding how CBL programs should be structured and assessed. Future research directions include empirical quantitative evaluation of CBL's pedagogical effectiveness and the use of CBL for teaching professional skills.},

Reasons are varied, including that this approach has proven to prepare competitive students who are skilled to address the main problems of society once they enter the labor market. Active Learning is a student-centered-learning approach that involves the learner directly in the process. It consists of letting students be the main actors of the learning process by performing meaningful activities and critically thinking about what they are doing. In this research, a review of Active Learning is performed. The focus is on presenting concepts and practices central to Active Learning that leading universities are deploying, universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, North Carolina State University and Aalborg University. Also, the authors describe in this paper a case from their experience with Active Learning techniques in specified areas of engineering education at Tecnologico de Monterrey. Results indicate that this approach supports the development of in-demand competencies such as Teamwork, Problem-solving and Analysis. In addition, students’ performance and retention rates are improved. In the engineering field, students can acquire and practice different technical skills under supervision. Active Learning is a very flexible approach that can be integrated in a gradual manner by any organization. The authors have constructed this research to be a useful guide to Active Learning practices. It can support engineering professors and people interested in knowing or adopting this approach for improving their students’ results.},

Autonomous robots, simulation, horizontal and vertical integration, the Industrial Internet of Things, additive manufacturing, augmented reality, cybersecurity, the cloud, and Big Data and analytics are technologies considered pillars of the I4 approach. Nowadays, there are universities already offering programs related to I4. These range from those aimed at presenting the concepts of I4 to those in which students learn how to handle related technologies in real work in global enterprises. I4 is still evolving, and we present only a glimpse of what is required based on its current state. Continuous review of the I4 environment is necessary to determine opportunely the path that it will follow and, in consequence, the needs that will emerge in areas such as curricula content, competency requirements, and technologies.},

However, research on its usability in the design field is still explorative, and previous studies are often contradictory regarding the usability of VR for 3D model review. This paper argues that the usability of VR should be assessed by analysing human factors such as spatial perception and taking into consideration the complexity of the reviewed product. Hence, a comparative evaluation study has been conducted to assess spatial perception in desktop interface-based and VR-based review of 3D models of products with different levels of complexity. The results show that participants in VR more could perceive the fit of user interface elements, and estimation of the model dimensions had a lower relative error than in desktop interface. It has been found that various sensory cues are used to perceive the model size and that the employed sensory cues depend on the level of complexity. Finally, it is proposed that differences between a desktop interface and VR for reviewing models are more evident when reviewing models of higher complexity levels.},

  abstract = {Engineering education refers to developing an understanding of the principles, methods, and ways of thinking that underlie engineering, and preparing students and engineers for productive engineering careers. The purpose of this review is to explore how head-mounted display-based virtual reality (HMD VR) can contribute to these goals. Historically, engineering has not been a focus for VR in education. However, recent technical advances and decreasing prices are driving a growing public interest in applying HMD VR in this field. This article reviews 47 publications on this topic, primarily appearing from 2015 to May of 2020. The literature reveals that engineering researchers and instructors have broadly explored the potential of HMD VR in organized engineering instruction and training. However, rigorous evaluation appears to be somewhat lacking in the reviewed research, and most studies are conducted in a small-scale laboratory setting. Nonetheless, HMD VR seems to be able to motivate students to learn and it is perceived to be useful in engineering education. Researchers are recommended to explore the methods of using HMD VR to facilitate lifelong learning, especially for the retraining and re-employment of engineers who seek to change careers or collaborate with researchers in different disciplines. Engineering instructors may benefit from professional development that focuses on student-centered pedagogies and skills attuned to the latest HMD VR systems.},

  abstract = {The use of animation and multimedia for learning is now further extended by the provision of entire Virtual Reality Learning Environments (VRLE). This highlights a shift in Web-based learning from a conventional multimedia to a more immersive, interactive, intuitive and exciting VR learning environment. VRLEs simulate the real world through the application of 3D models that initiates interaction, immersion and trigger the imagination of the learner. The question of good pedagogy and use of technology innovations comes into focus once again. Educators attempt to find theoretical guidelines or instructional principles that could assist them in developing and applying a novel VR learning environment intelligently. This paper introduces the educational use of Web-based 3D technologies and highlights in particular VR features. It then identifies constructivist learning as the pedagogical engine driving the construction of VRLE and discusses five constructivist learning approaches. Furthermore, the authors provide two case studies to investigate VRLEs for learning purposes. The authors conclude with formulating some guidelines for the effective use of VRLEs, including discussion of the limitations and implications for the future study of VRLEs.},

  abstract = {Communications for information synchronisation during the conceptual design phase usually require designers to employ more flexible and intuitive digital design tools. In developing such support tools, a case study research was initiated to first understand the current state of communication among novice design team members. The main purpose of the study is to understand the novice designers' collaboration culture when working on conceptual architectural design projects. The overall case study research involves 1) ethnography for data collection and 2) artefact and protocol analyses for data analysis. This paper presents the latter data analyses based on the earlier ethnography results about novice designers' conceptual design and technology design synthesis strategies. Data analyses on the characteristics of utilised external representation tools indicate that although conventional manual sketching is beneficial for providing rich intuitive design concepts, they have limitations when novice designers need to oversee complicated design problems. The study also found that although current conventional CAD tools are advantageous for detailed engineering design articulation, they do hinder novice designers' creativity due to their intuitive ideation limitation. Based on these results, this paper discusses the identified advantages and challenges of current design media and then proposes an alternative VR-based design interface for enhancing cognition and communication among designers during the conceptual design phase.},

In this paper, we present Surrogate-Aloud as a remote ideation and usability method that establishes a surrogate relationship between participants and a facilitating researcher through video conferencing. The researcher wears a VR headset and shares their viewpoint through video conferencing to a remote participant, who applies think-aloud protocol to express movement and interaction commands to be executed by the researcher, alongside their thought process as they interact with virtual prototypes or scenarios. We conducted a preliminary study to evaluate the Surrogate-Aloud method for remote usability evaluation and ideation of a new instructional technique with volumetric recordings. Results show that Surrogate-Aloud leverages the surrogate’s technical expertise and enables sufcient capability to conduct truly remote usability evaluation and ideation.},

We found that when participants learned object structure by actively rotating the objects, the objects were recognized faster during a subsequent recognition task than when object structure was learned through passive observation. We also found that participants focused their study time during active exploration on a limited number of object views, while ignoring other views. Overall, our results suggest that allowing active exploration of an object during initial learning can facilitate recognition of that object, perhaps owing to the control that the participant has over the object views upon which they can focus. The virtual reality environment is ideal for studying such processes, allowing realistic interaction with objects while maintaining experimenter control.},

  abstract = {We describe the framework for capturing the internal view of complex anatomical spaces via multiple media and haptic platforms, exemplified by realistic and conceptual representations of the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF). A realistic three-dimensional (3D) mesh of the PPF was developed by segmenting the osseous anatomy on computed tomography (CT) using Materialize InPrint. Subsequently in Autodesk 3D Studio Max, the realistic mesh was enhanced with graphically designed neurovascular anatomy and additionally a conceptual representation of the PPF with its connections and contents was created. An interactive web-compatible Adobe Flash tutorial using ActionScript was developed, allowing users to advance through a series of educational slides that contained interactive rotatable interior camera views and scrollable CT cross-sectional content, incorporating both the realistic and conceptual models. Both models were also 3D printed using polyamide material. In the realistic model, the neurovasculature was colored with water-based acrylic paint. A 3-piece modular design with embedded magnets allows for internal visualization and seamless assembly. A serious gaming environment of the conceptual PPF was also developed using Truevision3D application programming interface, where users can freely move around rooms and hallways that represent various spaces. Lastly, the realistic model was incorporated into a headset-based virtual reality environment, Surgical Theater, allowing visualization and fly-through inside and outside the model. Multiple 3D techniques for visualization of complex 3D anatomical spaces from within were described, with the necessary software and skills detailed. A rough estimate of the time and cost needed to develop these tools as well as multiple supplementary source and end result files are also made available. Educators could utilize multiple advanced delivery methods to incorporate custom digital 3D models of complex anatomical spaces understood from inside.},

The quality assessment shows that the study quality was below average according to the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument, especially for the studies that were designed as user evaluations of educational VR products. The review identified a number of situations where HMDs are useful for skills acquisition. These include cognitive skills related to remembering and understanding spatial and visual information and knowledge; psychomotor skills related to head-movement, such as visual scanning or observational skills; and affective skills related to controlling your emotional response to stressful or difficult situations. Outside of these situations the HMDs had no advantage when compared to less immersive technologies or traditional instruction and in some cases even proved counterproductive because of widespread cybersickness, technological challenges, or because the immersive experience distracted from the learning task.},

Without a clear understanding of the human side of virtual reality (VR), the experience will always fail.  The VR Book bridges this gap by focusing on human-centered design. Creating compelling VR applications is an incredibly complex challenge. When done well, these experiences can be brilliant and pleasurable, but when done badly, they can result in frustration and sickness. Whereas limitations of technology can cause bad VR execution, problems are oftentimes caused by a lack of understanding human perception, interaction, design principles, and real users. This book focuses on the human elements of VR, such as how users perceive and intuitively interact with various forms of reality, causes of VR sickness, creating useful and pleasing content, and how to design and iterate upon effective VR applications.  This book is not just for VR designers, it is for managers, programmers, artists, psychologists, engineers, students, educators, and user experience professionals. It is for the entire VR team, as everyone contributing should understand at least the basics of the many aspects of VR design. The industry is rapidly evolving, and The VR Book stresses the importance of building prototypes, gathering feedback, and using adjustable processes to efficiently iterate towards success. It contains extensive details on the most important aspects of VR, more than 600 applicable guidelines, and over 300 additional references.},

We present the results of an extensive Delphi survey on the future of additive manufacturing with a focus on its economic and societal implications in 2030. Via an initial round of extensive qualitative interviews and a Delphi-based analysis of 3510 quantitative estimations and 1172 qualitative comments from 65 experts, we were able to develop and validate 18 projections that were then clustered into a scenario for the most probable future. The scenario is built on the six Delphi projections with the highest consensus on the likelihood of occurrence. We complement this most probable scenario with a discussion on controversial, extreme scenarios. Based on these findings we derive implications for industry, policy, and future research.},

Conventionally, estimates of precision and inference for fixed effects are based on their asymptotic distribution, which is known to be inadequate for some small-sample problems. In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T2 type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different REML analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.},

The model stresses the importance of providing the player with immediate feedback, clear goals and challenges that are matched to his/her skill level. The flow theory is used as a framework to facilitate positive user experience in order to maximize the impact of educational games. Especially, the factors that contribute to flow experience are discussed. The experiential gaming model can be used to design and analyse educational computer games.

  abstract = {Since the first time the term "Virtual Reality" (VR) has been used back in the 60s, VR has evolved in different manners becoming more and more similar to the real world. Two different kinds of VR can be identified: non-immersive and immersive. The former is a computer-based environment that can simulate places in the real or imagined worlds; the latter takes the idea even further by giving the perception of being physically present in the non-physical world. While non-immersive VR can be based on a standard computer, immersive VR is still evolving as the needed devices are becoming more user friendly and economically accessible. In the past, there was a major difficulty about using equipment such as a helmet with goggles, while now new devices are being developed to make usability better for the user. VR, which is based on three basic principles: Immersion, Interaction, and User involvement with the environment and narrative, offers a very high potential in education by making learning more motivating and engaging. Up to now, the use of immersive-VR in educational games has been limited due to high prices of the devices and their limited usability. Now new tools like the commercial "Oculus Rift", make it possible to access immersive-VR in lots of educational situations. This paper reports a survey on the scientific literature on the advantages and potentials in the use of Immersive Virtual Reality in Education in the last two years (2013-14). It shows how VR in general, and immersive VR in particular, has been used mostly for adult training in special situations or for university students. It then focuses on the possible advantages and drawbacks of its use in education with reference to different classes of users like children and some kinds of cognitive disabilities (with particular reference to the Down syndrome). It concludes outlining strategies that could be carried out to verify these ideas.},

  abstract = {Background: Although literature and practice underline the potential of virtual reality (VR) for forensic mental healthcare, studies that explore why and in what way VR can be of added value for treatment of forensic psychiatric patients is lacking. Goals: This study aimed to identify (1) points of improvements in existing forensic mental health treatment of in- and outpatients, (2) possible ways of using VR that can improve current treatment, and (3) positive and negative aspects of the use of VR for the current treatment according to patients and therapists. Methods: Two scenario-based methods were used. First, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight therapists and three patients to elicit scenarios from them. Based on these results, six scenarios about possibilities for using VR in treatment were created and presented to 89 therapists and 19 patients in an online questionnaire. The qualitative data from both methods were coded independently by two researchers, using the method of constant comparison. Results: In the interviews, six main codes with accompanying sub codes emerged. Ideas for improvement of treatment were grouped around the unique characteristics of the forensic setting, characteristics of the complex patient population, and characteristics of the type of treatment. For possibilities of VR, main codes were skills training with interaction, observation of situations or stimuli without interaction, and creating insight for others into the patient. The questionnaire resulted in a broad range of insights into potential positive and negative aspects of VR related to the current treatment, the patient, the content of a VR application, and practical matters. Conclusion: VR offers a broad range of possibilities for forensic mental health. Examples are offering training of behavioral and cognitive skills in a realistic context to bridge the gap between a therapy room and the real world, increasing treatment motivation, being able to adapt a VR application to individual patients, and providing therapists with new insights into a patient. These findings can be used to ground the development of new VR applications. Nevertheless, we should remain critical of when in the treatment process and for whom VR could be of added value.},

  abstract = {With immersive experiences becoming a medium for mass communication, we need pedagogies as well as scientific, evidence-based design principles for immersive learning. To foster evidence-based designs of immersive learning, we detail an empirical evaluation of a geosciences field trip, common in undergraduate education across numerous disciplines. The study builds on a previously proposed research framework in which we detailed a basic taxonomy of virtual field trips distinguishing between basic, plus, and advanced immersive virtual field trip experiences. The experiment reported here expands the original evaluation of basic field trips into the realm of plus versions using pseudo-aerial 360◦ imagery to provide embodied experiences that are not possible during the actual field trip. We also refined our original experimental design placing a stronger focus on the qualitative feedback elicited from the students. Results show an overwhelmingly positive response of students to virtual field trips with significantly higher-valued learning experience and enjoyment. Furthermore, the introduction of pseudo-aerial imagery (together with higher image resolution) shows a significant improvement in the participants spatial situation model. As contextualizing and spatially grounding is essential for place-based learning experiences, plus versions of virtual field trips have the potential to add value to the learning outcome and immersive virtual field trip experience. We discuss these encouraging results as well as critical feedback from the participants, such as the absence of touch in virtual experiences, and lay out our vision for the future of immersive learning experiences across environmental sciences.},

Since classical times, people have used memory palaces as a spatial mnemonic to help remember information by organizing it spatially and associating it with salient features in that environment. In this paper, we explore whether using virtual memory palaces in a head-mounted display with head-tracking (HMD condition) would allow a user to better recall information than when using a traditional desktop display with a mouse-based interaction (desktop condition). We found that virtual memory palaces in HMD condition provide a superior memory recall ability compared to the desktop condition. We believe this is a first step in using virtual environments for creating more memorable experiences that enhance productivity through better recall of large amounts of information organized using the idea of virtual memory palaces.},

Topological optimization is also used depending on requirements. A significant impact on the final part quality is related to the part orientation and geometric dimensions. Therefore, this white paper focuses on detailed design steps to prepare future technicians and engineers to design for additive manufacturing. Active teaching pedagogy guideline is proposed. Students have to think in 3D and use analysis tools to create and validate the optimised design. They use immersive tools to review constraints and model diagnostic algorithm to generate data. Present approaches with design guidelines and tools enable to create AM rules based on it. Questionnaire shows that students need explicit knowledge information. Features recognition and geometry diagnostic are mandatory for complex model. Immersive tool helps to evaluate post-processing. They can now relate AM product-process relationship.},

In addition to it, many studies have made it a more versatile, common, and safer technology for the design and fabrication of components with the introduction of novel processes, materials, technologies, cost efficiency, and process design. In the present review article, the use of advanced aluminum alloys in the AM of fuselage, horizontal stabilizer, and high and low wings has gained increased advantages in the aerospace industry. Various components of wings and fuselage with its merits and demerits in AM processing are discussed. The outstanding issues in AM process and steps to overcome with post-processing techniques are elaborated. Finally, the future scope and research directions of the AM process involved in the fabrication of selected components are discussed.},

  abstract = {Context The computer-based teaching module (CBTM), which has recently gained prominence in medical education, is a teaching format in which a multimedia program serves as a single source for knowledge acquisition rather than playing an adjunctive role as it does in computer-assisted learning (CAL). Despite empirical validation in the past decade, there is limited research into the optimisation of CBTM design. This review aims to summarise research in classic and modern multimedia-specific learning theories applied to computer learning, and to collapse the findings into a set of design principles to guide the development of CBTMs. Methods Scopus was searched for: (i) studies of classic cognitivism, constructivism and behaviourism theories (search terms: ‘cognitive theory’ OR ‘constructivism theory’ OR ‘behaviourism theory’ AND ‘e-learning’ OR ‘web-based learning’) and their sub-theories applied to computer learning, and (ii) recent studies of modern learning theories applied to computer learning (search terms: ‘learning theory’ AND ‘e-learning’ OR ‘web-based learning’) for articles published between 1990 and 2012. The first search identified 29 studies, dominated in topic by the cognitive load, elaboration and scaffolding theories. The second search identified 139 studies, with diverse topics in connectivism, discovery and technical scaffolding. Based on their relative representation in the literature, the applications of these theories were collapsed into a list of CBTM design principles. Results Ten principles were identified and categorised into three levels of design: the global level (managing objectives, framing, minimising technical load); the rhetoric level (optimising modality, making modality explicit, scaffolding, elaboration, spaced repeating), and the detail level (managing text, managing devices). Conclusions This review examined the literature in the application of learning theories to CAL to develop a set of principles that guide CBTM design. Further research will enable educators to take advantage of this unique teaching format as it gains increasing importance in medical education.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) continues to play an important role in product development, and many companies are searching for how to best integrate AM into their products, business models, and design processes. Often, AM is integrated into later stages of the design process for products during manufacturing and production. However, there is an opportunity to introduce AM in early-stage design, which could spark new business models and services in addition to re-thinking manufacturing for products. The central research question for this paper is what is an appropriate and useful tool to support innovations with AM early in the design process? Prior work has extracted and validated AM design principles. This paper describes the strategic development of AM Principle Cards from these design principles. The cards are a vehicle for codified AM design principles to be shared and understood in a way that inspires learning, creativity, and AM considerations during the early stages of the design process. They implement a number of bestknown practices from an inductive principle-extraction study and literature related to the use of design stimuli, learning theory, design by analogy, and creativity. The AM cards were awarded a Singapore Good Design Award (SG Mark) for 2019. The AM Principle Cards were validated in two studies. In this paper, an ideation study is conducted with 85 designers to elicit feedback about the cards’ effectiveness to explain concepts related to AM and their ability to inspire creativity and new innovations. An additional ideation study was conducted with 61 participants that showed significant improvement in quality and novelty of ideas. The full deck of the final 27 AM Principle Cards is shared for design educators and practitioners to use.},

This research observed the entire product development cycle within three companies in the fields of consumer electronics (CE), footwear (FW), and medical devices (MD). Our guiding research questions are: What is a prototype? What are the roles of prototypes across these three companies? Through our analysis, we uncovered that prototypes are tools for enhanced communication, increased learning, and informed decision-making. Specifically, we further refine these categories to display the types of communication, learning, and decision-making that occur. These insights are significant because they validate many prior prototyping theories and claims, while also adding new perspectives through further exploiting each role. Finally, we provide newly modified definitions of a prototype and prototyping based on this empirical work, which we hope expands designers' mental models for the terms.},

Design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) is nowadays a major challenge to exploit properly the potential of AM in product innovation and product manufacturing. However, in recent years, several DFAM methods have been developed with various design purposes. In this paper, we first present a state-of-the-art overview of the existing DFAM methods, then we introduce a classification of DFAM methods based on intermediate representations (IRs) and product's systemic level, and we make a comparison focused on the prospects for product innovation. Furthermore, we present an assembly based DFAM method using AM knowledge during the idea generation process in order to develop innovative architectures. A case study demonstrates the relevance of such approach. The main contribution of this paper is an early DFAM method consisting of four stages as follows: choice and development of (1) concepts, (2) working principles, (3) working structures, and (4) synthesis and conversion of the data in design features. This method will help designers to improve their design features, by taking into account the constraints of AM in the early stages.},

Equipment downtime, costly instructors, and dangerous working environments are some of the impediments of hands-on training. To overcome these hurdles, a traditional manufacturing paper manual was transformed into a serious game through capturing and embedding expert knowledge. Aim. This article investigates the learning effectiveness of learning via a serious game (Training Game) compared with the tradition learning method (Paper Manual) through a user study. Method. Twenty employees took part in a randomised controlled trial. They were assigned to one of two conditions: Training Game (experimental condition), or Paper Manual (control condition). Participants spent a maximum of 30 minutes to study manufacturing instructions before completing two tests to evaluate the amount of learning achieved. Results. The results show that the Training Game was more effective for learning procedu ral knowledge than the Paper Manual. Regarding factual knowledge, no significant difference was identified between the two conditions. In terms of motivation, increased engagement levels were reported in the Training Game condition. Conclusions. This user study shows evidence that the serious TG being evaluated is an effective method for training procedural knowledge in a complex manufacturing scenario.},

  abstract = {Fire is a major hazard in built environments. Fires in buildings cause fatalities, serious injuries and tremendous damage. Most fires can be extinguished in the early stages of the fire’s development, with the right equipment and correct use of the equipment. However, as there can be as little as a few minutes between a fire starting and very dire consequences, rapid and correct responses are critical. Implementing effective training solutions is necessary to enable members of the public, who are not experts in fire safety, to use a fire extinguisher correctly. This can assist to build resilience to fires. In recent decades, virtual reality (VR) has aroused the fire safety community’s attention, as a smart, safe and effective training method compared to the traditional methods of lectures, non-interactive videos, and brochures. VR has been used for training for fire emergency preparedness and to collect data about evacuee decision-making, but VR has rarely been applied to a fully immersive training experience about fire extinguishers operation steps. Fire extinguisher operation steps are Pull, Aim, Squeeze and Sweep. Each step is critical to quickly extinguish a fire. This paper compares fire extinguisher training using a VR simulation with a non-interactive training video and evaluates the trainees learning of a fire extinguisher’s basic operation steps, in terms of knowledge acquisition, retention of information and change of self-efficacy. The results showed that the VR trainees scored better than video trainees, in terms of knowledge acquisition, even if the same trend was observed for long term retention of information. It was also observed that VR training provided a higher increment of self-efficacy right after the training. The VR group participants had maintained the same level of self-efficacy even 3–4~weeks after the training, while the video group had shown a significant drop of self-efficacy.},

  abstract = {Engineering students are often unaware of manufacturing challenges that are introduced during the design process. Students will sometimes design parts that are either very difficult or impossible to manufacture, because they are unaware of the intricacies and limitations of various manufacturing processes. Design for manufacturability (DFM) education must be improved to address these issues, and this work is a vision for implementation of a rapid method for facilitating DFM education in terms of subtractive and additive manufacturing processes. The goal is to teach students about how their designs impact ease and cost of manufacturing, in addition to giving them knowledge and intuition to fluidly move between both additive and subtractive manufacturing mindsets. This work describes use of a commercial high-performance computing (HPC)-accelerated parallelized trajectory planning software package called SculptPrint, which enables students to visualize the subtractive manufacturability of the parts they design. While SculptPrint is currently limited to subtractive manufacturability analysis, this work also describes the future development of a manufacturability analysis tool for Additive Manufacturing (AM). Analysis is performed on a set of sample parts for both subtractive and additive manufacturing. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced manufacturability tools in manufacturing process selection with consideration of manufacturing time, cost, and complexity. A distributed architecture is also examined that will allow students to perform manufacturability analysis without physical access to HPC hardware.},

Designers can create AM components with complex internal features, organic topologies, and lattice structures to reduce part mass or part count. However, such complex features can make designs difficult or impossible to inspect using mature nondestructive testing (NDT) methods. Professional organizations suggest designers keep quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) in mind early in the design process. The Design for Inspectability (DfI) framework is suggested as a way of meeting the need for early-stage QA/QC considerations. This work presents a case study, where a group of designers considered one type of NDT, known as Pulse-Echo Ultrasonic (PEU) testing. Using heuristics derived from relevant literature, designers were able to create designs with increased inspectability. This improved inspectability came at the cost of other design objectives, however, such as strength and mass. This implies that certain design objectives may be inversely related to increased inspectability, raising significant concerns for the field. This work marks the first step toward mapping out the trade-offs between inspection and performance objectives.},

The main objectives of this study were to determine the consequences of adding immersive VR to virtual learning simulations, and to investigate whether the principles of multimedia learning generalize to immersive VR. Furthermore, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to obtain a direct measure of cognitive processing during learning. A sample of 52 university students participated in a 2 × 2 experimental cross-panel design wherein students learned from a science simulation via a desktop display (PC) or a head-mounted display (VR); and the simulations contained on-screen text or on-screen text with narration. Across both text versions, students reported being more present in the VR condition (d = 1.30); but they learned less (d = 0.80), and had significantly higher cognitive load based on the EEG measure (d = 0.59). In spite of its motivating properties (as reflected in presence ratings), learning science in VR may overload and distract the learner (as reflected in EEG measures of cognitive load), resulting in less opportunity to build learning outcomes (as reflected in poorer learning outcome test performance).},

However, different terminology and operationalizations of presence across fields have plagued the comparability and generalizability of results across studies. Lee's (2004) unified understanding of presence as a multidimensional construct made up of physical, social, and self-presence, has created a unified theory of presence; nevertheless, there are still no psychometrically valid measurement instruments based on the theory. Two studies were conducted that describe the development of a standardized multidimensional measure of presence (the MPS) for a VR learning context based on this theory, and its validation using confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory. The results from Study 1 which included 161 medical students from Denmark indicated that the items used in the MPS measure a three dimensional theoretical model of presence: physical, social, and self-presence. Furthermore, IRT analyses indicated that it was possible to limit the number of items in the MPS to 15 (five items per sub-dimension) while maintaining the construct validity and reliability of the measure. The results of Study 2, which included 118 biology students from Scotland, supported the validity and generalizability of the MPS in a new context.},

The sample consisted of 199 university students (120 females), who learned from a desktop VR genetics simulation as a mandatory part of an undergraduate medical genetics course. The results indicated that there were two general paths by which desktop VR led to increases in the amount of learning following a VR lesson: an affective path that went through VR features, presence, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy; and a cognitive path that went through VR features, usability, cognitive benefits, and self-efficacy. It is concluded that learners may benefit from desktop VR simulations in which efficacious VR features and a high level of usability are emphasized.},

  abstract = {Over the past years, the concept of human-machine interaction has received ample attention to achieve hybrid automation in manufacturing.~A form of hybrid automation is taking benefit from the synergistic effect of human-robot collaboration. When used in assembly, the requirement of flexibility, adaptability and safety makes the design and redesign of human-robot collaborative (HRC) systems a complex and prone to error process. The use of time-based continuous simulations can offer safe virtual space for testing and validation thus easing the design of complex HRC systems. However, conventional simulations don’t allow to experience the future production system as an end-user in an immersive environment. This paper explores the technological development in virtual reality (VR) for design of human-centred production systems and develops a unified framework to integrate human-robot simulation with VR. The simulation as an event-driven simulation helped in estimating the human-robot cycle times, developing process-plan, layout optimisation and robot control program. The same simulation is used in VR to interact with the production equipment and particularly with the robot. Additionally, AWS Sumerian environment is used to create a virtual robot to assist VR user in the design process.},

Over 270 participants from four different learning settings experienced an immersive underwater world designed to show the process and effects of rising sea water acidity. In all of our investigations, after experiencing immersive VR people demonstrated knowledge gains or inquisitiveness about climate science and in some cases, displayed more positive attitudes toward the environment after comparing pre- and post-test assessments. The analyses also revealed a potential post-hoc mechanism for the learning effects, as the more that people explored the spatial learning environment, the more they demonstrated a change in knowledge about ocean acidification. This work is unique by showing distinct learning gains or an interest in learning across a variety of participants (high school, college students, adults), measures (learning gain scores, tracking data about movement in the virtual world, qualitative responses from classroom teachers), and content (multiple versions varying in length and content about climate change were tested). Our findings explicate the opportunity to use immersive VR for environmental education and to drive information-seeking about important social issues such as climate change.},

  abstract = {Although there is a substantial growth in the Additive Manufacturing (AM) market commensurate with the demand for products produced by AM methods, there is a shortage of skilled designers in the workforce that can apply AM effectively to meet this demand. This is due to the innate complications with cost and infrastructure for high-barrier-to-entry AM processes such as powder bed fusion when attempting to educate designers about these processes through in-person learning. To meet the demands for a skilled AM workforce while also accounting for the limited access to the range of AM processes, it is important to explore other mediums of AM education such as computeraided instruction (CAI) which can increase access to hands-on learning experiences. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the use of CAI in AM process education and focus on its effects on knowledge gain and cognitive load. Our findings show that when designers are educated about material extrusion and powder bed fusion through CAI, the knowledge gain for powder bed fusion is significantly different than knowledge gain for material extrusion, with no significant difference in cognitive load between these two AM processes. These findings imply that there is potential in virtual mediums to improve a designer’s process-centric knowledge for the full range of AM processes including those that are usually inaccessible. We take these findings to begin developing recommendations and guidelines for the use of virtual mediums in AM education and future research that investigates implications for virtual AM education.},

  abstract = {Adopting additive manufacturing (AM) in product design is limited by the shortage of skilled designers with design for AM (DfAM) expertise. This lack of AM talent is a major hurdle for organizations looking for innovative solutions to solve emerging engineering problems. Developing institutional talent in DfAM and AM process knowledge is of paramount importance to support organizations looking to leverage AM. Therefore, future designers need meaningful experiences to acquire DfAM intuition and AM process competency to enable informed artifact generation during the design process. This necessitates supplying active experiences that highlight the advantages and limitations of AM technologies and promote DfAM intuition. However, limited access to in-person experiences with physical AM systems inhibits designers from gaining such intuition. Digital modalities of AM education, such as computer-aided (CAx) and virtual reality (VR) tools, can alternatively provide access to experiential learning to cultivate this AM expertise. Where CAx experiences are typically associated with non-immersive modalities, VR experiences can offer enhanced immersion to replicate in-person experiences. There is a gap in the literature, however, that investigates immersive and non-immersive modalities on their effectiveness in training and artifact generation for AM. Additionally, there is a scarcity of information on design guides for creating immersive experiences that can support these research endeavors. It is essential to establish guidance on designing immersive experiences that offer meaningful and active engagement with AM technologies. Such guidance will support the development of experiences that cultivate DfAM intuition, AM process competency, and problem-solving skills. This research is thus motivated to explore the design of immersive VR experiences for problem-solving and artifact generation with AM. For this purpose, this work presents a generalized framework to inform the design of such experiences along with an example created using the proposed framework.},

The presented work here investigates the design of immersive VR user experiences for this purpose with support from the literature and findings in previously published work.},

  abstract = {Although the additive manufacturing (AM) market continues to grow, industries face barriers to AM adoption due to a shortage of skilled designers in the workforce that can apply AM effectively to meet this demand. This shortage is attributed to the high cost and infrastructural requirements of introducing high- barrier-to-entry AM processes such as powder bed fusion (PBF) into in-person learning environments. To meet the demands for a skilled AM workforce, it is important to explore other mediums of AM education, such as computer-aided instruction (CAI) and virtual reality (VR), which can increase access to hands-on learning experiences for inaccessible AM processes. However, limited work compares virtual and physical AM instruction or explores how the differences in immersion and presence between mediums can affect the knowledge gained and the mental effort exerted when learning about different AM processes. To address this gap in the literature, this research evaluates the use of CAI, VR, and in-person instruction in AM process education when learning about material extrusion (ME) and PBF. Our findings show that the differences in immersion and presence between CAI, VR, and in-person instruction do not have a statistically significant effect when learning about ME, but do have a significant effect when learning about PBF. Specifically, we found that VR generally yields equivalent effects in knowledge gain and cognitive load to in-person PBF education while offering advantages in both metrics over CAI learning. The findings from this work thus have significant implications for using VR as an alternative to in-person training to improve designer development in process-centric AM education of typically high-barrier-to-entry AM processes.},

However, there is a deficit of designers skilled to innovate with this technology due to challenges in supporting designers with tools and education for their development in design for AM (DfAM). There is a need to introduce intuitive tools and knowledge to enable future designers to DfAM. Immersive virtual reality (VR) shows promise to serve as an intuitive tool for DfAM to aid designers during design evaluation. The goal of this research is to, therefore, identify the effects of immersion in design evaluation and study how evaluating designs for DfAM between mediums that vary in immersion, affects the results of the DfAM evaluation and the mental effort experienced from evaluating the designs. Our findings suggest that designers can use immersive and non-immersive mediums for DfAM evaluation without experiencing significant differences in the outcomes of the evaluation and the cognitive load experienced from conducting the evaluation. The findings from this work thus have implications for how industries can customize product and designer-talent development using modular design evaluation systems that leverage capabilities in immersive and non-immersive DfAM evaluation.},

  abstract = {Applications for additive manufacturing (AM) continue to increase as more industries adopt the technology within their product development processes. There is a growing demand for designers to acquire and hone their design for AM (DfAM) intuition and generate innovative solutions with AM. Resources that promote DfAM intuition, however, historically default to physical or digitally non-immersive modalities. Immersive virtual reality (VR) naturally supports 3D spatial perception and reasoning, suggesting its intuitive role in evaluating geometrically complex designs and fostering DfAM intuition. However, the effects of immersion on DfAM evaluations are not well-established in the literature. This study contributes to this gap in the literature by examining DfAM evaluations for a variety of designs across modalities using varying degrees of immersion. Specifically, it observes the effects on the outcomes of the DfAM evaluation, the effort required of evaluators, and their engagement with the designs. Findings indicate that the outcomes from DfAM evaluations in immersive and non-immersive modalities are similar without statistically observable differences in the cognitive load experienced during the evaluations. Active engagement with the designs, however, is observed to be significantly different between immersive and non-immersive modalities. By contrast, passive engagement remains similar across the modalities. These findings have interesting implications on how organizations train designers in DfAM, as well as on the role of immersive modalities in design processes. Organizations can provide DfAM resources across different levels of immersion, enabling designers to customize how they acquire DfAM intuition and solve complex engineering problems.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an augmented reality (AR) framework and tool on smartphones as an alternative to conventional inspection for AM parts. The framework attempts to introduce the rapid inspection potential of smartphone based AR within manufacturing by leveraging the manufacturing capability of additive manufacturing (AM) to integrate markers onto AM parts. The key step from this framework that is explored in this paper is the design and quality assessment of AM markers for marker registration. As part of the marker design and quality assessment objectives, this research conducts an evaluation on the effects of different AM processes on the quality of augmentation achieved from AM fiducial markers. Furthermore, it evaluates the minimum fiducial pattern size that on integration onto AM parts will be viable for augmentation. The results suggest that the AM process and the size of the fiducial pattern play a significant role in determining the quality of the AM markers. The paper concludes by stating that dual material extrusion AM markers provide the highest number of detectable features and therefore the highest quality of AM markers, and the smallest viable fiducial pattern for Cybercode/QR code marker can be sized at 19 × 19mm2.},

Final artifacts were assessed for manufacturability and quality of final design, and design behaviors were captured via the eye-tracking data. Statistical analysis of design behavior duration shows that participants with more than 3 years of industry experience spend significantly less time removing material and revising than those with less experience. Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) analysis of the design behaviors gives insight to the transitions between behaviors through which designers proceed. Findings show that high-performing designers proceeded through four behavioral states, smoothly transitioning between states. In contrast, low-performing designers roughly transitioned between states, with moderate transition probabilities back and forth between multiple states.},

However, key manufacturing constraints need to be explored and understood in order to guide designers in their use of the PolyJet process including (1) minimum manufacturable feature size, (2) removal of support material, (3) survivability of small features, and (4) the self-supporting angle in the absence of support material. The authors use a design of experiments (DOE) approach to identify the statistical significance of geometric and process parameters and to quantify the relationship between these significant parameters and part manufacturability. The results from this study include the identification of key variables, relationships, and quantitative design thresholds necessary to establish a preliminary set of design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) guidelines for material jetting. Experimental design studies such as the one in this paper are crucial to provide designers with the knowledge to ensure that their proposed designs are manufacturable with the PolyJet process, whether designed manually or by an automated method, such as topology optimization (TO).},

The social science and engineering communities have adopted two vastly different approaches to solving this problem, both of which have been deployed throughout engineering design research. The goal of this paper was to compare and contrast these two approaches using design ratings of nearly 1000 engineering design ideas paired with a qualitative study with expert raters. The results of this study identify that while these two methods provide similar ratings of idea quality, there was a statistically significant negative relationship between these methods for ratings of idea novelty. Qualitative analysis of recordings from expert raters’ think aloud concept mapping points to potential sources of disagreement. In addition, the results show that while quasi-expert and expert raters provided similar ratings of design novelty, there was not significant agreement between these groups for ratings of design quality. The results of this study provide guidance for the deployment of idea ratings in engineering design research and evidence for the development and potential modification of engineering design creativity metrics.},

Several educational methodologies are reviewed in the context of manufacturing and through the lens of sustainability. It is found that there is a need to identify and understand the STEM educational challenges, and to assess the usefulness of existing methodologies using case-based analyses. In particular, this research aims to support student learning in manufacturing engineering through real-time process evaluations. A pedagogical framework is presented that can assist engineering educators in developing learning modules in support of this goal. The framework encompasses four steps: define the learning outcomes, create instructional resources, create active learning resources, and create a summative assessment mechanism. The framework emphasizes engagement of manufacturing engineering students in psychomotor learning, which remains a challenge due to the high cost of instructional laboratories. The framework is applied to develop a participatory pedagogy for manufacturing courses through the use of computer numerical control of manufacturing operations, and real-time monitoring, visualization, and data analysis of machine energy use. The framework is demonstrated for upper-level undergraduate and graduate manufacturing engineering courses at two universities (i.e., Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing at Oregon State University and Precision Manufacturing at University of California, Berkeley).

Manufacturing systems simulation has proven to be a powerful tool for designing and evaluating a manufacturing system due to its low cost, quick analysis, low risk and meaningful insight that it may provide, improving thus the understanding of the influence of each component. Simulation comprises an indispensable set of IT tools and methods for the successful implementation of digital manufacturing. It allows experimentation and validation of product, process, and system design and configuration.

  abstract = {Traditional plaster casts often cause dermatitis due to disadvantages in usability and wearability. Additive manufacturing (AM) can fabricate customized casts to have light-weight, high strength, and better air permeability. Although existing studies have provided design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) guidelines to facilitate design applications for AM, most relevant studies focused on the mechanical properties of outputs and too general/specific design guidelines; novice designers may still have difficulty understanding trade-offs between functional and operational performance of various DfAM aspects for medical casts. As a response, this study proposes a DfAM worksheet for medical casts to effectively guide novice designers. First, important DfAM criteria and their possible solutions for medical casts are examined through a literature review to construct a basic DfAM framework for medical casts. Next, a scoring system that considers relative criteria importance and criteria evaluation from both functional and operational perspectives is developed to identify the overall suitability of a medical cast design for AM. A case study of finger cast designs was performed to identify the DfAM performance of the sample designs along with redesign requirements suggested by the worksheet. The proposed worksheet would be used to achieve rapid medical cast design by objectively assessing its suitability for AM.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the intercoder reliability (ICR) of a coding frame is frequently recommended as good practice in qualitative analysis. ICR is a somewhat controversial topic in the qualitative research community, with some arguing that it is an inappropriate or unnecessary step within the goals of qualitative analysis. Yet ICR assessment can yield numerous benefits for qualitative studies, which include improving the systematicity, communicability, and transparency of the coding process; promoting reflexivity and dialogue within research teams; and helping convince diverse audiences of the trustworthiness of the analysis. Few guidelines exist to help researchers negotiate the assessment of ICR in qualitative analysis. The current article explains what ICR is, reviews common arguments for and against its incorporation in qualitative analysis and offers guidance on the practical elements of performing an ICR assessment.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Virtual Reality (VR) has been shown to be an effective assistive tool in the engineering design process, aiding designers in ergonomics studies, data visualization, and manufacturing simulation. Yet there is little research exploring the advantages of VR to assist in the design for the additive manufacturing (DfAM) process. VR may present advantages over traditional computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and these advantages may be more evident as designs become more complex. The following study investigates two types of environments: 1) Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) and 2) Non-Immersive Virtual Reality (CAD) and the advantages that each environment gives to designers to assess parts for additive manufacturing. The two environments are compared to assess potential differences in DfAM decision-making. Participants familiar with DfAM are tasked with evaluating five designs of varying complexity using the Design for Additive Manufacturing Worksheet. Participant scores, evaluation times, and self-reported metrics are recorded and analyzed. Our findings indicate that as part complexity increases, DfAM scores and evaluation times increasingly differ between VR and CAD groups. We found that the VR group evaluates more complex parts at a faster rate, but with a lower accuracy when compared to the CAD group. In evaluating self-reported metrics, both groups were relatively similar; however, the CAD group reported improved confidence in identifying stress concentrations in DfAM parts. Our findings in this research identify VR as a design evaluation tool that enhances evaluation speed which speaks to its efficiency and usability; however, VR in its current form may not present the resolution necessary to identify smaller details when compared to CAD, the more accurate evaluation tool.},

In this research, virtual reality (VR) is proposed as a medium to help teach introductory concepts of AM in an interactive, scalable manner. Before implementing VR as a standard tool to teach introductory concepts of AM, we must evaluate the effectiveness of this medium for the subject. We test the hypothesis that VR can be used to teach students introductory concepts of AM in a way that is as effective as teaching the same concepts in a real-world physical setting. The research also explores differences in learning between participants who engage in a hands-on interactive lesson and participants who engage in a hands-off passive lesson. The study assesses participants’ AM knowledge through pre-/post-AM lesson evaluation. AM conceptual knowledge gained and changes in self-efficacy are evaluated to make an argument for the effectiveness of VR as an AM learning tool. Our findings in this research indicate that both interactive and passive VR may be indeed used to effectively teach introductory concepts of AM; we also found advantages to using interactive VR for improving AM self-efficacy.},

The real chemical plant sections are recreated in the virtual environment of the system. The system provides users with two kinds of walkthrough modes, demonstration of the structure and operation principle of some main equipment as well as the operating functions of setting up some major pumps and valves so as to strengthen the students’ understanding of the chemical process and train their operative ability. In addition, its virtual treatment of emergency can help to enhance the safety production awareness of the students and cultivate their ability to respond to unexpected emergency. The students’ feedback to our survey indicates that, despite some suggestions for further improvement, the virtual platform has more advantages and characteristics compared with traditional practice mode, and is effective in helping them understand the chemical process and equipment. What is more, some improvement has been made to perfect the system with students’ suggestions fully taken into consideration.},

  abstract = {The goals of the study were (a) to compare the instructional effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) versus a desktop slideshow as media for teaching scientific knowledge, and (b) to examine the efficacy of adding a generative learning strategy to a VR lesson. In Experiment 1, college students viewed a biology lesson about how the human body works either in immersive VR or via a self-directed PowerPoint slideshow on a desktop computer. Based on interest theory, it was predicted that students who learned in immersive VR would report more positive ratings of interest and motivation and would score higher on a posttest covering material in the lesson. In contrast, based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, it was predicted that students who learned with a well-designed slideshow would score higher on a posttest, although they might not report higher levels of interest and motivation. The results showed that students who viewed the slideshow performed significantly better on the posttest than the VR group, but reported lower motivation, interest, and engagement ratings. In Experiment 2, students either viewed a segmented VR lesson and produced a written summary after each segment or viewed the original, continuous VR lesson as in Experiment 1. Students who summarized the lesson after each segment performed significantly better on the posttest and the groups did not differ on reported interest, engagement, and motivation. These results support the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and demonstrate the value of generative learning strategies in immersive VR environments.

  abstract = {Intelligent automation, including robotics, is one of the current trends in the manufacturing industry in the context of “Industry 4.0”, where cyber-physical systems control the production at automated or semi-automated factories. Robots are perfect substitutes for a skilled workforce for some repeatable, general, and strategically-important tasks. However, this transformation is not always feasible and immediate, since certain technologies do not provide the required degree of flexibility. The introduction of collaborative robots in the industry permits the combination of the advantages of manual and automated production. In some processes, it is necessary to incorporate robots from different manufacturers, thus the design of these multi-robot systems is crucial to guarantee the maximum quality and efficiency. In this context, this paper presents a novel methodology for process automation design, enhanced implementation, and real-time monitoring in operation based on creating a digital twin of the manufacturing process with an immersive virtual reality interface to be used as a virtual testbed before the physical implementation. Moreover, it can be efficiently used for operator training, real-time monitoring, and feasibility studies of future optimizations. It has been validated in a use case which provides a solution for an assembly manufacturing process.},

Project work and guided small group work also present themselves as alternatives for conventional engineering education. PBL has been implemented as a partial strategy for Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at Technische Universiteit Eindhoven. The differences between the medical and the engineering implementation are analysed. PBL offers good prospects in the ® rst few years of a programme, especially if group work tutorials and some directive teaching are added. In later phases project work offers a strong alternative. The conclusion is that PBL has certain limitations, which make it less suitable as an overall strategy for engineering education.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising set of technologies to digitally simulate industrial processes and interaction between humans and machines. However, the use of immersive VR simulations is still limited in industry due to the uncertainty of benefits in respect with traditional digital tools, and the lack of structured methodologies to effectively implement immersive virtual simulations in practice. This paper deals with the application of VR to create virtual manufacturing simulations with the aim to design assembly lines in compliance with factory ergonomics. It proposes a methodology to allow the virtualization and simulation of assembly tasks using a combination of VR tools by replicating, or rather anticipating, what would happen at the shop floor. The adopted tools are Unity 3D for virtual environment generation, HTC VIVE to immerse the user in the virtual factory layout, Xsens as tracking system, and Leap Motion for gesture recognition. The paper also compares the new VR-based procedure with a more traditional desktop-based digital simulation on industrial cases. Results show that the new methodology is more precise to detect the operator’s comfort angles and more powerful to predict process criticalities and optimize factory layout design. At the same time, it is less sensitive to errors during ergonomic assessment related to the expert’s subjectivity during the analysis.},

  abstract = {A structural evaluation is imperative for developing an effective virtual learning environment. Understanding the extent to which content that has been learned virtually can be applied practically holds particular importance. A group of persons from the technical field of mechanical and plant engineering (N = 13) participated in a virtual operator training for a case application of additive manufacturing. To evaluate the virtual learning environment the participants answered quantitative questionnaires and were asked to apply what they had learned virtually to the real machine. Both the virtual training and testing phase on the real machine were recorded by video (800 minutes in total). The category system resulting from a structured qualitative video analysis with a total of 568 codes contains design-, instruction- and interaction-related optimisation potentials for further development of the virtual learning sequence. Mistakes, difficulties and other anomalies during the application on the real machine provide further revision options. The study uses video data for the first time to derive optimisation potentials and to investigate the learning transfer of virtually learned action knowledge to the real-world activity. Practitioner Notes What is already known about the topic? A combination of quantitative and qualitative data for formative evaluation is feasible to improve the quality of virtual learning environments and maintain critical constructive feedback. Relevant aspects for evaluating virtual learning environments include usability, technology acceptance, motivation and learning efficiency. Different methods for measuring the learning efficiency of VR training exist, eg, subjective measures or pretests/posttests. What this paper adds: An immersive virtual environment with its specific methodical-didactic concept is introduced. Video data are used for the first time to derive optimisation potentials in a formative evaluation. The procedure of extracting and analysing the data in a structured video analysis is introduced in the paper. Learning transfer of the virtually learned content to the real-world context of action is assessed and applied in the field of mechanical and plant engineering on a complex real machine for the first time. Implications for practice and/or policy: The described methodical procedure using video analysis enables deriving design-, instruction- and interaction-related optimisation potentials. The results show that spatial information was transferred to the real machine without any issues, whereby the main difficulties appeared during steps that require haptic feedback. The use of IVR should be critically assessed due to the effort required in creation.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, due to rapid prototyping processes improvements, a functional metal part can be built directly by Additive Manufacturing. It is now accepted that these new processes can increase productivity while enabling a mass and cost reduction and an increase of the parts functionality. However, the physical phenomena that occur during these processes have a strong impact on the quality of the produced parts. Especially, because the manufacturing paths used to produce the parts lead these physical phenomena, it is essential to considerate them right from the parts design stage. In this context, a new numerical chain based on a new design for Additive Manufacturing (DFAM) methodology is proposed in this paper, the new DFAM methodology being detailed; both design requirements and manufacturing specificities are taken into account. The corresponding numerical tools are detailed in the particular case of thin-walled metal parts manufactured by an Additive Laser Manufacturing (ALM) process.},

  abstract = {The capabilities of additive manufacturing (AM) enable designers to gen­ erate and build creative solutions beyond the limitations of traditional manufacturing. However, designers must also accommodate AM limita­ tions to minimize build failures. Several researchers have proposed design tools and educational interventions for integrating design for AM (DfAM) in engineering design. However, there is a need to investigate the effect of DfAM training on industry professionals’ use of these techniques and its subsequent effects on the creativity of their designs. In this paper, we present a workshop-based study in which industry professionals were sequentially introduced to opportunistic and restrictive DfAM. Participants were also given a DfAM task, with short idea generation sessions conducted between each content lecture. The participants’ designs and their DfAM and creative self-efficacies were compared from before to after receiving DfAM training. The results show that DfAM training successfully increased participants’ restrictive DfAM self-efficacy; however, no changes were seen in their opportunistic DfAM or creative self-efficacies. Further, the results show an increase in the uniqueness and overall creativity of the participants’ designs, but no significant changes were seen in the initially high usefulness of the designs. These findings suggest that DfAM training presents an opportunity to encourage creative idea generation.},

To meet this growing need, several academic institutions have implemented educational interventions, especially project- and problem-based, for AM education; however, limited research has explored how the choice of the problem statement influences the design outcomes of a task-based AM/DfAM intervention. This research explores this gap in the literature through an experimental study with 175 undergraduate engineering students. Specifically, the study compared the effects of restrictive and dual (restrictive and opportunistic) DfAM education, when introduced through design tasks that differed in the explicit use of design objectives and functional and manufacturing constraints in defining them. The effects of the intervention were measured through (1) changes in participant DfAM self-efficacy, (2) participants' self-reported emphasis on DfAM, and (3) the creativity of participants' design outcomes. The results show that the choice of the design task has a significant effect on the participants' self-efficacy with, and their self-reported emphasis on, certain DfAM concepts. The results also show that the design task containing explicit constraints and objectives results in participants generating ideas with greater uniqueness compared with the design task with fewer explicit constraints and objectives. These findings highlight the importance of the chosen problem statement on the outcomes of a DfAM educational intervention, and future work is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Research in additive manufacturing (AM) has increased the use of AM in many industries, resulting in a commensurate need for a workforce skilled in AM. In order to meet this need, educational institutions have undertaken different initiatives to integrate design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) into the engineering curriculum. However, limited research has explored the impact of these educational interventions in bringing about changes in the technical goodness of students' design outcomes, particularly through the integration of DfAM concepts in an engineering classroom environment. This study explores this gap using an experimental study with 193 participants recruited from a junior-level course on mechanical engineering design. The participants were split into three educational intervention groups: (1) no DfAM, (2) restrictive DfAM, and (3) restrictive and opportunistic (dual) DfAM. The effects of the educational intervention on the participants' use of DfAM were measured through changes in (1) participants' DfAM self-efficacy, (2) technical goodness of their AM design outcomes, and (3) participants' use of DfAM-related concepts when describing and evaluating their AM designs. The results showed that while all three educational interventions result in similar changes in the participants' opportunistic DfAM self-efficacy, participants who receive only restrictive DfAM inputs show the greatest increase in their restrictive DfAM self-efficacy. Further, we see that despite these differences, all three groups show a similar decrease in the technical goodness of their AM designs, after attending the lectures. A content analysis of the participants' design descriptions and evaluations revealed a simplification of their design geometries, which provides a possible explanation for the decrease in their technical goodness, despite the encouragement to utilize the design freedom of AM to improve functionality or optimize the weight of the structure. These results emphasize the need for more in-depth DfAM education to encourage the use of both opportunistic and restrictive DfAM during student design challenges. The results also highlight the possible influence of how the design problem is stated on the use of DfAM in solving it.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) processes offer unique capabilities (i.e., opportunities) yet inherent limitations (i.e., restrictions) due to the layer-by-layer fabrication of parts. Despite the newfound design freedom and increased use of AM, limited research has investigated how knowledge of the AM processes affects the creativity of students’ ideas after being exposed to AM. This study investigates this gap through an experimental study with 343 participants recruited from a junior-level mechanical engineering design course. The participants were exposed to three variations in design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) education: (1) no DfAM, (2) restrictive DfAM, and (3) opportunistic and restrictive (dual) DfAM education. The effects of these three interventions were measured through differences in (1) participants’ self-reported use of DfAM in a design challenge and (2) expert assessment of the creativity of the outcomes from the said design challenge. The results of the study indicated that variations in DfAM content did not result in differences in the participants’ self-reported use of either opportunistic or restrictive DfAM, with all three groups reporting similar levels of emphasis. Further, participants from all three groups reported higher use of restrictive DfAM techniques, compared with opportunistic DfAM. Moreover, while variations in the content had no effect on the creativity (uniqueness and usefulness) of the participants’ design outcomes, teaching both opportunistic and restrictive DfAM did result in the generation of designs with greater AM technical goodness—a novel and significant finding in our study. The results of this study highlight the need for DfAM educational interventions that encourage students to not only learn about but also integrate both opportunistic and restrictive concepts effectively into their creative design process. This would result in the generation of innovative products that leverage the design freedom enabled by AM, yet addressing the limitations inherent in the process.},

Despite this need for an AM-skilled workforce, little research has systematically investigated the formulation of educational interventions for training engineers in DfAM. In this article, we synthesize findings from our experiments with 596 engineering design students to inform the development of educational interventions—comprising content presentations and design tasks—that encourage student learning and creativity. Specifically, we investigated the effects of four variations of DfAM educational interventions by manipulating the following: (1) the content of DfAM information presented, (2) the order of presenting the DfAM content, (3) the definition of the AM design task, and (4) the competitive structure of the AM design task. The effects of these variations were experimentally tested by comparing changes in students' DfAM self-efficacy and the creativity of students' design outcomes. Validated measures were also developed as part of our studies to help mature the nascent field of DfAM education. Based on the findings of our experiments, we discuss how task-based educational interventions can be formulated to (1) increase students' DfAM self-efficacy, (2) encourage students to generate ideas of high AM technical goodness, and (3) encourage students to generate more creative ideas when using AM. The novel synthesis of our findings in this article will help educators formulate effective DfAM educational interventions and tasks to foster a workforce skilled in DfAM.},

The results showed that the use of certain DfAM considerations, such as minimum feature size and support material mass, successfully predicted the performance of the AM designs.

Topics are introduced by presenting specific observations, case studies or problems, and theories are taught or the students are helped to discover them only after the need to know them has been established. This study reviews several of the most commonly used inductive teaching methods, including inquiry learning, problem-based learning, project-based learning, case-based teaching, discovery learning, and just-in-time teaching. The paper defines each method, highlights commonalities and specific differences, and reviews research on the effectiveness of the methods. While the strength of the evidence varies from one method to another, inductive methods are consistently found to be at least equal to, and in general more effective than, traditional deductive methods for achieving a broad range of learning outcomes.},

  abstract = {Researchers have explored the benefits and applications of virtual reality (VR) in different scenarios. VR possesses much potential and its application in education has seen much research interest lately. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied immersive VR for higher education purposes that considers the usage of both high-end and budget head-mounted displays (HMDs). Hence, we propose using systematic mapping to identify design elements of existing research dedicated to the application of VR in higher education. The reviewed articles were acquired by extracting key information from documents indexed in four scientific digital libraries, which were filtered systematically using exclusion, inclusion, semi-automatic, and manual methods. Our review emphasizes three key points: the current domain structure in terms of the learning contents, the VR design elements, and the learning theories, as a foundation for successful VR-based learning. The mapping was conducted between application domains and learning contents and between design elements and learning contents. Our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of VR in the higher education sphere—for instance, learning theories were not often considered in VR application development to assist and guide toward learning outcomes. Furthermore, the evaluation of educational VR applications has primarily focused on usability of the VR apps instead of learning outcomes and immersive VR has mostly been a part of experimental and development work rather than being applied regularly in actual teaching. Nevertheless, VR seems to be a promising sphere as this study identifies 18 application domains, indicating a better reception of this technology in many disciplines. The identified gaps point toward unexplored regions of VR design for education, which could motivate future work in the field.},

This enables designers to be more creative with their designs and build parts which may be difficult to manufacture using conventional processes. However, as AM is in its infancy, relevant literature with respect to design guidelines for AM is not readily available. This research proposes a novel approach to implement design guidelines in AM using a systematic graph based approach. These design rules will assist designers to come up with efficient part designs that can be manufactured with minimum part errors. The design rules are formulated by studying the relationship between input part geometry and AM process parameters. A feature graph based design analysis method is proposed along with a Producibility Index (PI) which is used to compare the designs. Modifications in part design based on these rules and their comparison is presented in the form of three case studies.},

  abstract = {There is a growing consensus that 3D printing technologies will be one of the next major technological revolutions. While a lot of work has already been carried out as to what these technologies will bring in terms of product and process innovation, little has been done on their impact on business models and business model innovation. Yet, history has shown that technological revolution without adequate business model evolution is a pitfall for many businesses. In the case of 3D printing, the matter is further complicated by the fact that adoption of these technologies has occurred in four successive phases (rapid prototyping, rapid tooling, digital manufacturing, home fabrication) that correspond to a different level of involvement of 3D printing in the production process. This article investigates the effect of each phase on the key business model components. While the impact of rapid prototyping and rapid tooling is found to be limited in extent, direct manufacturing and, even more so, home fabrication have the potential to be highly disruptive. While much more value can be created, capturing value can become extremely challenging. Hence, finding a suitable business model is critical. To this respect, this article shows that 3D printing technologies have the potential to change the way business model innovation is carried out, by enabling adaptive business models and by bringing the ‘rapid prototyping’ paradigm to business model innovation itself.},

A non-technical consumer may pay significantly more for a 3D printer with “no assembly required”. Since it is reasonable to assume that they may not understand how the printer works and what will come out of it, they may wind up returning it because it does not meet their expectations. While consumers are starting to use 3D printers, designers in industry are utilizing Rapid Prototyping (RP) machines to manufacture final products in addition to prototypes. Designers will need to know AM principles in order to communicate design specifications to a RP lab technician so that a part passes Quality Assurance inspection. Training users on fundamental layer-based manufacturing methods can assist before and after a 3D printer purchase and reduce the strain on RP labs in industry.},

  abstract = {The convergence of technologies currently observed in the field of Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, robotics and consumer electronic reinforces the trend of new applications appearing every day. But when transferring knowledge acquired from research to businesses, research laboratories are often at a loss because of a lack of knowledge of the design and integration processes in creating an industrial scale product. In fact, the innovation approaches that take a good idea from the laboratory to a successful industrial product are often little known to researchers. The objective of this paper is to present the results of the work of several research teams that have finalized a working method for researchers and manufacturers that allow them to design virtual or augmented reality systems and enable their users to enjoy “a compelling Virtual Reality experience”. That approach, called “the I2I method”, present 11 phases from “Establishing technological and competitive intelligence and industrial property” to “Improvements” through the “Definition of the Behavioral Interface, Virtual Environment and Behavioral Software Assistance”. As a result of the experience gained by various research teams, this design approach benefits from contributions from current Virtual Reality \& Augmented Reality research. Our objective is to validate and continuously move such multidisciplinary design team methods forward.},

The focus is on two questions: how use of computer simulations can enhance traditional education, and how computer simulations are best used in order to improve learning processes and outcomes. We report on studies that investigated computer simulations as a replacement of or enhancement to traditional instruction. In particular, we consider the effects of variations in how information is visualized, how instructional support is provided, and how computer simulations are embedded within the lesson scenario. The reviewed literature provides robust evidence that computer simulations can enhance traditional instruction, especially as far as laboratory activities are concerned. However, in most of this research the use of computer simulations has been approached without consideration of the possible impact of teacher support, the lesson scenario, and the computer simulation’s place within the curriculum.},

  abstract = {Aims and Objectives This study explored nursing students’ views of using virtual reality in healthcare. Background The popularity and use of virtual reality in healthcare delivery and education is on the rise. Yet, the views of future nurses regarding this technology remain underexplored. Design This is a qualitative descriptive study guided by a naturalistic inquiry and reported using the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist. Methods Nursing students (n = 26) were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling. They were first exposed to a virtual reality intervention aimed to enhance men's awareness of testicular diseases. This was attempted to familiarise participants with the technology and initiate conversations around its use in healthcare. Participants were then interviewed face-to-face, either individually or within focus groups. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Four themes were identified: (i) positive experiences of virtual reality; (ii) challenges to using virtual reality; (iii) settings where virtual reality can be implemented; and (iv) blue-sky and future applications of virtual reality. Participants described this technology as novel, enjoyable, immersive, memorable and inclusive. They questioned, however, the suitability of virtual reality for older adults, reported minor technical difficulties and stressed the importance of prior preparation in the use of the technology. Virtual reality was recommended for use in outpatient healthcare settings, schools and the community. Participants suggested using virtual reality in health promotion, disease prevention and management, and to promote nurses’ empathy towards patients. Conclusions Findings highlight the potential role of virtual reality in assisting nurses in promoting health and managing disease. Future research is needed to establish the long-term effect of virtual reality interventions among more diverse participants. Relevance to clinical practice Virtual reality can be implemented in outpatient, educational and community settings in order to promote health, prevent disease, enhance disease and self-management, and increase nurses’ empathy towards patients.},

It can be challenging for novice designers to create successful designs for additive manufacturing (AM), due to its recent surge in popularity and lack of formal education or training. A study was carried out to investigate the way novices apply DfAM heuristics when they receive them at different points in the design process. A design problem was presented to students, and three different groups of student participants were given a lecture on DfAM heuristics at three different points in the design process: before the initial design, between the initial design and redesign, and after the redesign. The novelty and quality of each of the resulting designs were evaluated. Results indicate that although the DfAM heuristics lecture had no impact on the overall quality of the designs generated, participants who were given the heuristics lecture after the initial design session produced designs that were better-suited for 3D printing in the second phase of the design activity. However, receiving this additional information appears to prevent students from creatively iterating upon their initial designs, as participants who received heuristic information between the design sessions experienced a decrease in novelty between the two sessions. Additionally, receiving the heuristics lecture increased all students’ perceptions of their ability to perform DfAM-related tasks. These results validate the practicality of design heuristics in lecture form as AM training tools while also emphasizing the importance of iteration in the design process.},

  abstract = {In design for additive manufacturing, an essential task is to determine the optimal build orientation of a part according to one or multiple factors. Heuristic search is used by the most part orientation methods to select the optimal orientation from a large solution space. Search algorithms occasionally converge towards the local optimum and waste considerable time on trial and error. This issue could be addressed if there was an intelligent agent that knew the optimal search path for a given 3D model. A straightforward method to construct such an agent is reinforcement learning (RL). By adopting this idea, the time-consuming online searches in existing part orientation methods will be moved to the offline learning stage, potentially improving part orientation performance. This is a challenging problem because the goal is to build an agent capable of rotating arbitrary 3D models, whereas RL agents frequently struggle to generalize in new scenarios. Therefore, this paper suggests a generalizable reinforcement learning (GRL) framework to train the agent, and a GRL benchmark to support the training, testing, and comparison of part orientation approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method on average outperforms others in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. It is proved to have the potential to solve the local minima problems raised in the existing approaches, to swiftly discover the global (sub-)optimal solution (i.e., on average 2.62× to 229.00× faster than the random search algorithm), and to generalize beyond the environment in which it was trained.},

  abstract = {This study explored virtual reality (VR) as an educational tool to offer immersive and experiential learning environments to biomedical engineering (BME) students. VR and traditional two-dimensional (2D) videos were created and used to teach required communication skills to BME students' while working with clinical partners in healthcare settings. The videos of interdisciplinary teams (engineering and nursing students) tackling medical device-related problems, similar to those commonly observed in healthcare settings, were shown to BME students. Student surveys indicated that, through VR videos, they felt more immersed in real-world clinical scenarios while learning about the clinical problems, each team-member's areas of expertise, their roles and responsibilities, and how an interdisciplinary team operated collectively to solve a problem in the presented settings. Students with a prior in-person immersion experience, in the presented settings, reported VR videos to serve as a possible alternative to in-person immersion and a useful tool for their preparedness for real-world clinical immersion. We concluded that VR holds promise as an educational tool to offer simulated clinical scenarios that are effective in training BME students for interprofessional collaborations.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) started about 50 years ago in a form we would recognize today [stereo ­head-mounted display (HMD), head tracking, computer graphics generated images] – although the hardware was completely different. In the 1980s and 1990s, VR emerged again based on a ­different generation of hardware (e.g., CRT displays rather than vector refresh, electromagnetic tracking instead of mechanical). This reached the attention of the public, and VR was hailed by many engineers, scientists, celebrities, and business people as the beginning of a new era, when VR would soon change the world for the better. Then, VR disappeared from public view and was rumored to be “dead.” In the intervening 25 years a huge amount of research has nevertheless been carried out across a vast range of applications – from medicine to business, from psychotherapy to industry, from sports to travel. Scientists, engineers, and people working in industry carried on with their research and applications using and exploring different forms of VR, not knowing that actually the topic had already passed away.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the concepts of immersion and presence in virtual environments. We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomic responses and more gross behaviour of a participant in a VE. The paper considers single and multi-participant shared environments, and draws on the experience of Computer-Supported Cooperative Working (CSCW) research as a guide to understanding presence in shared environments. The paper finally outlines the aims of the FIVE Working Group, and the 1995 FIVE.},

Discussion of these aspects of computer based learning in engineering is supported by reference to programs in current use at Queen Mary College and elsewhere.},

In this paper, we argue and present evidence from vast research that VR is an excellent tool in engineering education. Through our review, we deduced that VR has positive cognitive and pedagogical benefits in engineering education, which ultimately improves the students’ understanding of the subjects, performance and grades, and education experience. In addition, the benefits extend to the university/institution in terms of reduced liability, infrastructure, and cost through the use of VR as a replacement to physical laboratories. There are added benefits of equal educational experience for the students with special needs as well as distance learning students who have no access to physical labs. Furthermore, recent reviews identified that VR applications for education currently lack learning theories and objectives integration in their design. Hence, we have selected the constructivist and variation learning theories as they are currently successfully implemented in engineering education, and strong evidence shows suitability of implementation in VR for education.},

The cognitive and behavioral advantages of virtual reality (VR) can help lecturers reduce entry barriers to concepts that students struggle with. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are imperative tools intensively utilized in the design and analysis of chemical engineering problems. Although CFD simulation tools can be directly applied in engineering education, they bring several challenges in the implementation and operation for both students and lecturers. In this study, we develop the “Virtual Garage” as a task-centered educational VR application with CFD simulations to tackle these challenges. The Virtual Garage is composed of a holistic immersive virtual reality experience to educate students with a real-life engineering problem solved by CFD simulation data. The prototype is tested by graduate students (n\,=\,24) assessing usability, user experience, task load and simulator sickness via standardized questionnaires together with self-reported metrics and a semi-structured interview. Results show that the Virtual Garage is well-received by participants. We identify features that can further leverage the quality of the VR experience with CFD simulations. Implications are incorporated throughout the study to provide practical guidance for developers and practitioners.},

Virtual manufacturing enables manufacturers to optimize their production processes using real-time data from sensors and other connected devices in Industry 4.0. Web-based virtual manufacturing platforms are a critical component of Industry 4.0, enabling manufacturers to design, test, and optimize their processes collaboratively and efficiently. In Industry 4.0, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is used to provide real-time visibility and control of the supply chain as well as to enable the automation of various manufacturing processes. Big data analytics can be used in conjunction with virtual manufacturing to provide valuable insights and optimize production processes in Industry 4.0. Artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual manufacturing have the potential to enhance the effectiveness, consistency, and adaptability of manufacturing processes, resulting in faster production cycles, better-quality products, and lower prices. Recent developments in the application of virtual manufacturing systems to digital manufacturing platforms from different perspectives, such as the Internet of things, big data analytics, additive manufacturing, autonomous robots, cybersecurity, and RFID technology in Industry 4.0, are discussed in this study to analyze and develop the part manufacturing process in Industry 4.0. The limitations and advantages of virtual manufacturing systems in Industry 4.0 are discussed, and future research projects are also proposed. Thus, productivity in the part manufacturing process can be enhanced by reviewing and analyzing the applications of virtual manufacturing in Industry 4.0.},

  abstract = {Research on immersive learning in natural setting such as schools, especially with/in virtual reality (VR), is only just emerging. While current inquiry concentrates on measuring content and procedural knowledge acquisition and to a lesser extent attitudinal change associated with exposure to VR applications, scant attention has been paid to what learners actually do in immersive virtual environments. This includes on- and off-task behavior, higher order thinking, and regulation of learning related to self and others. This methodological paper describes the use of screen capture video as a means of recording and analysing these types of learning behaviors in virtual environments with junior high school students. The paper outlines barriers, limitations and benefits to using screen capture video and the types of inductive and deductive analysis conducted as part of the research. It concludes that screen capture video is a promising medium for understanding verbal and non-verbal learning behavior as it actually unfolds in immersive VR.},

  abstract = {Product dissection has been widely deployed in engineering education as a means to aid in student's understanding of functional product elements, development of new concept ideas, and their preparation for industry. However, there are large variations in the dissection activities employed in education with little research geared at understanding the impact of these variations on student cognitive load requirements and, ultimately, student conceptual understanding. This is problematic because without this knowledge, we do not know what components of product dissection impact (positively or negatively) conceptual understanding of the dissected product and how this is related to the cognitive requirements of the dissection activity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate how the type of product dissected (complexity and product power source), the virtuality of the product (physical or virtual), and the type of dissection activity performed impacted student conceptual understanding and cognitive requirements through a factorial experiment with 141 engineering students. While the type of cognitive load varied between virtually and physically dissecting products, no differences were found in subsequent levels of conceptual understanding. This indicates that virtual environments may be used as a proxy for physical environments without impacting the conceptual understanding of products by students. These results are used to develop recommendations for the use of product dissection in education and propel future research that investigates relationships between example-based design practices and student understanding outcomes.},

  abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0, offering unique advantages and capabilities. The interest in AM has been steadily increasing, leading to its rapid recent growth and improvement in all its aspects. However, its wider adoption is hindered by various barriers, the most important of which are the relatively high initial investment cost, part quality issues, limited material choices, and lack of expertise. The research community, AM machine developers, and larger enterprises are continuously contributing to the improvement of the first three factors. Nonetheless, the same cannot be stated for the barrier of limited expertise, leading the industrial sector to a perpetual lack of knowledge and, therefore, reluctance for a potential AM uptake. This study is addressing the need of the industrial sector for structured and organized expertise training for the fruitful exploitation of AM, paving the road for its wider application. The guidelines for an industrial-oriented AM training curriculum are set through the development of an AM training framework. The different AM thematic areas are classified into educational modules, which are separately analyzed, considering the participants’ active role and hands-on practice. The proposed step-by-step approach builds up from introductory to more advanced concepts, ensuring flexibility and simultaneously encompassing the needs of all industrial stakeholders (engineers, designers, managers, operators). Additionally, strategies corroborating the accessibility of the proposed framework are discussed, as well as dissemination policies and tools to facilitate its industrial endorsement.},

  abstract = {The present study suggests an approach to teaching a novel additive manufacturing (AM) course for engineering students at the graduate level, developed in 2015 and taught currently at Afeka Academic College of Engineering. The proposed course is dedicated to the fundamentals, methods, materials, standards and industrial applications of AM, and involves introduction lectures, special topic lectures organized with industry and academic experts, laboratory training and final engineering projects. For this purpose, a pedagogical project-based learning (PBL) model was developed with the main goal of using the AM techniques for innovation projects dealing with devices for people with disabilities. Three selected study cases of high level student projects designed, printed and presented during the 2017–2018 course are reviewed herein. The first project proposed by the students was to develop and build an opener for medicine containers; the second was to design and build a device for pouring liquids for people with Parkinson’s disease; and the third was to design and construct a 3D puzzle for blind or visually impaired people. All three projects were designed with a computer-aided design program and then printed using the ABS material. Quality control (three-point bending tests and light microscopy) was routinely conducted on standard specimens printed on the same tray with the components. Once the mean maximal flexural stress obtained from the standard specimens exceeded the acceptance values, the parts were approved and assembled, and the mechanical assemblage was examined. The learning process included two iteration steps that were executed to improve and optimize the structural design. The final 3D printed objects, the students’ presentations, their experience, as reflected in their final reports, and their personal written evaluations, lead to the conclusion that the projects served as useful learning experience for engineering education. Hence, it is suggested that modern mechanical engineering education programs should adopt a multidisciplinary PBL approach when developing future AM courses in order to encourage students’ creativity, learning motivation and engagement.},

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory was introduced in the 1980s as an instructional design theory based on several uncontroversial aspects of human cognitive architecture. Our knowledge of many of the characteristics of working memory, long-term memory and the relations between them had been well-established for many decades prior to the introduction of the theory. Curiously, this knowledge had had a limited impact on the field of instructional design with most instructional design recommendations proceeding as though working memory and long-term memory did not exist. In contrast, cognitive load theory emphasised that all novel information first is processed by a capacity and duration limited working memory and then stored in an unlimited long-term memory for later use. Once information is stored in long-term memory, the capacity and duration limits of working memory disappear transforming our ability to function. By the late 1990s, sufficient data had been collected using the theory to warrant an extended analysis resulting in the publication of Sweller et al. (Educational Psychology Review, 10, 251–296, 1998). Extensive further theoretical and empirical work have been carried out since that time and this paper is an attempt to summarise the last 20 years of cognitive load theory and to sketch directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Background. Recent research on the influence of presentation format on the effectiveness of multimedia instructions has yielded some interesting results. According to cognitive load theory (Sweller, Van Merrie¨nboer, \& Paas, 1998) and Mayer’s theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2001), replacing visual text with spoken text (the modality effect) and adding visual cues relating elements of a picture to the text (the cueing effect) both increase the effectiveness of multimedia instructions in terms of better learning results or less mental effort spent. Aims. The aim of this study was to test the generalisability of the modality and cueing effect in a classroom setting. Sample. The participants were 111 second-year students from the Department of Education at the University of Gent in Belgium (age between 19 and 25 years). Method. The participants studied a web-based multimedia lesson on instructional design for about one hour. Afterwards they completed a retention and a transfer test. During both the instruction and the tests, self-report measures of mental effort were administered. Results. Adding visual cues to the pictures resulted in higher retention scores, while replacing visual text with spoken text resulted in lower retention and transfer scores. Conclusions. Only a weak cueing effect and even a reverse modality effect have been found, indicating that both effects do not easily generalise to non-laboratory settings. A possible explanation for the reversed modality effect is that the multimedia instructions in this study were learner-paced, as opposed to the system-paced instructions used in earlier research.},

  abstract = {While Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes provide unparalleled design freedom, they still impose some constraints on the geometries that can be successfully fabricated. Thus, there exists a need for predictive analysis of part geometries’ manufacturability. Existing algorithms based on surface representations require several computationally intensive manipulations. In this paper, the authors present a framework for performing manufacturability analysis of parts to be manufactured by AM using a voxel-based representations schema. The input triangular mesh is first converted into a voxel representation using Ray Casting. Through a series of simple computations on a binary three-dimensional array, the tool provides feedback on infeasible features, minimum feature size, support material, orientation and manufacturing time for different build orientations. The tool’s ability to effectively analyze parts for manufacturability is evaluated against several sample geometries.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacture (AM) is receiving significant attention globally, reflected in the volume of research being carried out to support the commercialisation of the technology for industrial applications and the interest shown by government and policy makers in the technology. The lack of distinction between 3D printing and AM, as well as the portrayal of some highly publicised applications, may imply that the technology is now firmly established. However, this is not the case. The aim of this study is to identify the current barriers to the progression of AM for end-use products from an industrial perspective and to understand the nature of those barriers. Case study research has been conducted with organisations in the UK aerospace, automotive, defence, heavy machinery and medical device industries. Eighteen barriers are identified: education, cost, design, software, materials, traceability, machine constraints, in-process monitoring, mechanical properties, repeatability, scalability, validation, standards, quality, inspection, tolerances, finishing and sterilisation. Explanation building and logic models are used to generalise the findings. The results are discussed in the context of current academic research on AM. The outcomes of this study help to inform the frontiers of research in AM and how AM research agendas can be aligned with the requirements for industrial applications.},

Analogous to reverse engineering, the strategy instructs engineering students from final product to model creation, closing the gap between theory and practice. Incorporating 3D printing bridges this divide, enhancing understanding, creativity and problem-solving. The study underscores technology's influence on learning strategies, aligning with the surge of 3D printing in education. Results link advanced design technology usage to improved student performance, with 3D-printed materials yielding 45\% higher grades and 30\% faster task completion.

This study examines the perceptions of chemical engineering students and professionals towards the use of VR games for health and safety education and training, and discusses the practical implications of findings. The study found that students and professionals believe that IVR games are useful for learning. A comparison of the two groups revealed that professionals were more accepting of the technology compared to students. Students presented concerns with the use of the technology for classroom learning. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of the findings to higher education practice.},

  abstract = {The increasing dissemination of virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) compels the elucidation of how these didactic tools can improve their effectiveness at the formative level. The motivation generated in students by a VRLE is revealed as a key factor in achieving meaningful learning, but such a motivation by itself alone does not guarantee the long-term retention of knowledge. To identify the necessary characteristics of a VRLE to achieve an appropriate level of meaningful learning, this paper compares a set of VRLEs created in previous years with a group of recently developed VRLEs, after being used by engineering students. A description of the design process of the both VRLEs groups is included in this paper. Most significantly, analysis of the response of a total of 103 students in a specific survey reveals how a step-by-step protocol system helped improve students' knowledge and retention after one year of using a VRLE. Thus, this study not only demonstrates the importance of using modern development engines when creating or updating a VRLE to achieve student motivation, but also justifies in many cases the use of a step-by-step protocol as a method to improve the long-term retention of knowledge.},

Then, a VR environment with technological characteristics of interactivity, hypertextuality, virtuality (presence of virtual elements), modality, location specificity, mobility and connectivity has been designed. VR environment shows a virtual supermarket in the form of 360 degree video able to create highly immersive sensory experiences that promote the subjective presence of consumers and impress their senses, touch their hearts, and stimulate their minds. The results obtained show that applying virtual technology to marketing activities allows marketers to identify and respond to opportunities through new technologies which are faster, more effective, and lower cost and to become more responsive to consumers’ needs providing virtual experience where they want it, how they want it and when they want it.},

  abstract = {Engineering idea generation is a crucial part of new product development, and physical modeling is a widely used tool. Despite the physical models’ popularity in the idea generation process, little is known about their effects on design cognition. The existing literature provides contradicting guidelines about their use in the design process. Product design firms call for the frequent use of physical models, but some studies suggest that physical models induce design fixation. The psychological literature indicates that physical representations, by supporting designers’ mental models of physical phenomena, might lead to more feasible designs. The advantages and disadvantages of physical models as idea generation tools need to be clarified to help designers decide when and where to implement them. Based on prior studies and anecdotal evidence, two hypotheses are tested: (1) physical models supplement designer’s mental models and (2) physical models induce design fixation. Two between-subject idea generation experiments with novice designers are conducted to evaluate these hypotheses. In the first pilot experiment, the participants generate ideas in three conditions: sketching only, building, and building and testing. This study is followed by a second experiment, in which a new condition called constrained sketching is added. In each condition, participants use the representation implied by the name of the condition. The percentage of ideas satisfying all design requirements indicates the physical models’ effect on the designers’ mental models. Novelty and variety are used as metrics for design fixation. The percentage of functional ideas quantified shows significant variation across the sketching and building conditions, whereas novelty and variety show no differences. These results support the argument that physical models supplement novice designer’s mental models. No evidence of fixation is observed, which contradicts the results of the prior observational studies. Hypothesized reasons for the apparently contradictory results are also presented.},

Two researchers collaborate to apply a qualitative method, coding and synthesizing the results using multiple criteria. The main objective is to study the impact of games and simulations with regard to achieving specific learning objectives. On balance, results indicate that games and/or simulations have a positive impact on learning goals.

As a final step, the authors consolidate evidence for the benefit of academics and practitioners in higher education interested in the efficient use of games and simulations for pedagogical purposes.

The context of the competition was guided by the Department of Defense’s shared vision for forward deployment of AM systems to provide agile on-site part production and reduction of supply chain complexity. The competition vehicles were designed to allow future deployed military or civilian engineers to fabricate remotely-piloted vehicles while in battlefield or austere environmental conditions, such as the site of a natural disaster to search for survivors or to carry out reconnaissance missions. The competition served as unique informal learning environment that engaged over 200 students in the emerging principles of “design for Additive Manufacturing” (DfAM).

  abstract = {Many different additive manufacturing (AM) technologies enable the realization of prototypes and fully-functional artifacts. Although very different in solution principle and embodiment, significant functional commonality exists among the technologies. This commonality affords the authors an opportunity to propose a new classification framework for additive manufacturing technologies. Specifically, by following the systematic abstraction approach proposed by the design methodology of Pahl and Beitz, the authors first identify the working principles of each AM process. A morphological matrix is then employed to functionally present these principles such that commonalities between processes can be identified. In addition to using it as a means of classifying existing processes, the authors present the framework as a tool to aid a designer in the conceptual design of new additive manufacturing technologies. The authors close the paper with an example of such an implementation; specifically, the conceptual design of a novel means of obtaining metal artifacts from three-dimensional printing.},

  abstract = {Recent research argues for the supplementation of traditional anatomical training with emerging three-dimensional visualization technologies (3DVTs); however, little is known regarding the effect these technologies have on learner workload. In this experiment, sixty-one participants studied gross brain anatomy using either a plastic physical model (PM; n = 29) or models presented in virtual reality (VR; n = 32). Participants were fitted with a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor, worn on the prefrontal cortex. fNIRS measures regional saturation of oxygen (RSO2) and is indicative of workload. Participants then completed a pre-knowledge test on human brain anatomy. Participants were given 10 min to use the provided 3DVT to study 16 anatomical brain structures. Following the study period, participants completed additional surveys measuring workload, newly acquired anatomical knowledge, and cognitive resources used. Overall, anatomical knowledge increased at post-test and the change was no different between PM and VR conditions. Participants in the PM condition reported significantly higher levels of spatial workload, mental demand, and frustration. RSO2 values suggest left hemispheric increases from baseline during learning for the VR condition, but decreases for the PM condition. No other measures revealed differences between the two conditions. These results provide support for the supplementation of traditional anatomical training techniques with virtual reality technology as a way of alleviating workload. Further research is needed to explain the link between workload and performance in anatomical knowledge acquisition.},

  abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) technology still needs to evolve, but as the pace of innovations accelerates, systems allow for more novel modes of visualization and interaction to support engineering design reviews. Currently, the classic design review process is often performed on a PC with the support of CAD software packages. However, CAD on a screen cannot always meet all the requirements in regard to the functional and ergonomic validations of complex 3D models. In this paper, the development and evaluation of a VR-based tool to support engineering design review is described. “VRSmart” visualizes CAD data and allows for an intuitive interaction. In a preliminary user study, the tool was checked for its usability and user experience. VRSmart was then evaluated in a real industrial environment and tested in an authentic design review. The results indicate that a VR-supported design review allows users to see slightly more faults in a 3D model than in a CAD software-based approach on a PC screen. Furthermore, VR reduces the risk of exclusion of certain professional groups from the design review process. In addition, the intuitive interaction with the VR system allowed for a much faster entry into the design review. In summary, VR will not replace the traditional design review process on screen, but it provides a useful addition to engineering companies.},

  abstract = {Reviewing industrial designs is a complex task, since it includes various stakeholders with diverging needs and visions. A well-organized review process is essential, since it fosters collaboration between designers, engineers and final users. Computer-aided design (CAD) has started to be used as a communication tool during the design process to convey design ideas and support a better shared understanding of intentions. However, CAD software does not allow intuitive analysis and manipulation of 3D models for users without a CAD or computer science background. Using Virtual Reality (VR) technologies to enhance engineering design reviews has been an area of interest for researchers since the advent of modern VR. VR allows the user to interact with a 3D model in real-time and have an immersive experience. In this context, we propose a low cost multimodal VR-supported tool for design review. The application visualizes complex engineering data and provides a set of multimodal tools to inspect a 3D model on various levels. We discuss challenges that arose during the implementation process and provide best practices for future VR applications in the industrial sector.},

However, VR users’ perceptions, openness and learning effectiveness are seldom comprehensively evaluated, particularly in learning complex industrial operations. In this study, grounded in the technology acceptance model, a moderated mediation model of perceived usefulness, ease of use, openness to experience, and engagement in VR-based learning was developed. The model was empirically validated using responses collected from 321 users who were trained on aircraft and cargo terminal operations powered by a novel VR-based learning platform. A survey to measure openness to experience and a pre-training performance test were carried out, followed by a post-training survey of learners’ intrinsic factors, including the influence of perceived usefulness, openness to experience, and attitude towards learning. The study revealed that learners with an open attitude towards experiencing new technology tend to perceive VR technology as a useful platform for training. In addition, the learners with more positive views of VR technology-supported training were more engaged in learning.},

This balance calls for engaging students in active learning through new materials such as hands-on activities, interactive multimedia, and group learning. This balance with concrete experience is especially needed in “building-block” courses that create the foundation for advanced design courses. If we expect students to perform well with open-ended, project-centered problems, we need to provide a pedagogical basis across the entire undergraduate curriculum. This paper presents such a basis for one important engineering core topic: mechanics of materials. Active learning concepts applied in mechanics of materials courses are discussed, including specific examples of hands-on, multimedia, and group design exercises.},

In this paper, an automatic selection system of the building orientation based on the double-layer priority aggregation multi-attribute decision-making (DLPA-MADM) method is proposed to select the optimal building orientation (OBO). The priority compensation restricted average (PCRA) aggregation operator is designed to handle the priority relationships among attributes. The alternative building orientations (ABOs) are constructed according to the reference orientations of the surface features via the STEP AP242 file. The models of the surface precision with feature (P\&F), printing time (PT), layout area (LA), and support volume (SV) attributes who participate in decision-making are established. According to the tolerances given from the STEP file, the sub-precision values of ABOs for surface features with distinct priorities are aggregated in the first layer to obtain the precision value. Four attributes are aggregated in the second layer with priority to acquire the comprehensive evaluation value (CEV), through the ranking of which, the OBO can be found. The effectiveness and rapidity of the developed system are proved by experiments on the model.},

Spatial inspection was a key behavioural factor of VR sketching when considering its high-frequency repetitive and continuous interactions with a designer's representation activities throughout the concept generation process. The cognitive impact of VR sketching revealed the following decisive features: extension of solution space, enhancement of idea transformation and inducement to a holistic design approach for concept generation.

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is recognized as a disruptive technology that offers significant potentials for innovative design. Prior experimental studies have revealed that novice designers provided with AM knowledge (AMK) resources can generate a higher quantity and quality of solutions in contrast with control groups. However, these studies have adopted coarse-grain evaluation metrics that fall short in correlating AMK with radical or architectural innovation. This deficiency directly affects the capturing, modeling, and delivering AMK so that novel opportunities may be more efficiently utilized in ideation stage. To refine the understanding of AMK's role in stimulating design innovation, an experimental study is conducted with two design projects: (a) a mixer design project, and (b) a hairdryer redesign project. The former of which aims to discover whether AMK inspiration increases the quantity and novelty of working principles (WP) (i.e., radical innovation), while the latter examines the influence of AMK on layout and feature novelty (i.e., architectural innovation). The experimental study indicates that AMK does have a positive influence on architectural innovation while the effects on radical innovation are very limited if the example illustrating the AMK is functionally irrelevant to the design problem. Two strategies are proposed to aid the ideation process in maximizing the possibility of identifying AM potentials to facilitate radical innovation. The limitations of this study and future research plans are discussed.},

Design heuristics have been shown to facilitate the creation of new design concepts in the early, conceptual stage of the design process, as well as throughout the development of ideas. However, we know relatively little about their use in differing disciplines. This study examined evidence of design heuristic use in a protocol study with 12 mechanical engineers and 12 industrial designers who worked individually to develop multiple concepts. The open-ended design problem was for a novel product, and the designers’ sketches and comments were recorded as they worked on the problem for 25 min and in a retrospective interview. The results showed frequent use of design heuristics in both disciplines and a significant relationship to the rated creativity of the concepts. Though industrial designers used more heuristics in their concepts, there was a high degree of similarity in heuristic use. Some differences between design disciplines were observed in the choice of design heuristics, where industrial designers showed a greater emphasis on user experience, environmental contexts, and added features. These findings demonstrate the prevalence of design heuristics in individual concept generation and their effectiveness in generating creative concepts, across two design domains.},

To deal with these issues, this paper aims to introduce a new statistical method to develop fast automatic decision support tools for additive manufacturing build orientation determination. The proposed method applies a non-supervised machine learning method, K-Means Clustering with Davies–Bouldin Criterion cluster measuring, to rapidly decompose a surface model into facet clusters and efficiently generate a set of meaningful alternative build orientations. To evaluate alternative build orientations at a generic level, a statistical approach is defined. A group of illustrative examples and comparative case studies are presented in the paper for method validation. The proposed method can help production engineers solve decision problems related to identifying an optimal build orientation for complex and freeform CAD models, especially models from the medical and aerospace application domains with much efficiency. The proposed method avoids the limitations of traditional feature-based methods and pure computation-based methods. It provides engineers a new efficient decision-making tool to rapidly determine the optimal build orientation for complex and freeform CAD models.},

In this respect, physical prototyping can prove to be very lengthy and expensive, especially if modi®cations resulting from design reviews involve tool redesign. The availability and a ordability of advanced computer technology has paved the way for increasing utilization of prototypes that are digital and created in computer-based environments, i.e. they are virtual as opposed to being physical. The technology for using virtual prototypes was pioneered and adopted initially by large automotive and aerospace industries. Small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing industry also need to take virtual prototyping (VP) technology more seriously in order to exploit the bene®ts. VP is becoming very advanced and may eventually dominate the product development process. However, physical prototypes will still be required for the near future, albeit less frequently. This paper presents a general survey of the available VP techniques and highlights some of the most important developments and research issues while providing sources for further reference. The purpose of the paper is to provide potential SME users with a broad picture of the ®eld of VP and to identify issues and information relevant to the deployment and implementation of VP technology.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is an emerging type of production technology that is seen as the core technology for future high-value engineered products. Due to the additive nature of stacking and unifying individual layers, the part and process design is substantially different from conventional production methods. This paper addresses one of the challenging design aspects for additive manufacturing, namely the determination of the build orientation. The build orientation has a large impact on the final part quality and must therefore be chosen wisely. This paper presents an approach to support the build orientation selection by a feature-based design algorithm. After automated part tessellation and the detection of outer part surfaces, the algorithm determines candidate build orientations through a ray-tracing and convex hull method. Candidate solutions are ranked based on minimizing overhang structures, as this also minimizes the need for additional support structures.},
